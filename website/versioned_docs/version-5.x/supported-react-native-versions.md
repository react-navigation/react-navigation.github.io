React Navigation 5 depends on the new hooks API and libraries using `androidx`. So you'll need to be on at least `react-native@0.60.0`. If you're using Expo, your SDK version should be at least `36`.

You also need to make sure that your React Native version is compatible with following libraries:

- [react-native-gesture-handler](https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-gesture-handler#react-native-support)
- [react-native-reanimated](https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-reanimated)
- [react-native-screens](https://github.com/kmagiera/react-native-screens)

> Please note that the statements above may not be correct for a particular `react-native` version. If you notice a version that is not working properly, feel free to either file an [issue](https://github.com/react-navigation/react-navigation.github.io/issues/new) or correct it in this page.
