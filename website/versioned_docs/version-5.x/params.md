title: Passing parameters to routes
sidebar_label: Passing parameters to routes
---

Remember when I said "more on that later when we talk about `params`!"? Well, the time has come.

Now that we know how to [create a stack navigator with some routes](hello-react-navigation.md) and [navigate between those routes](navigating.md), let's look at how we can pass data to routes when we navigate to them.

There are two pieces to this:

1. Pass params to a route by putting them in an object as a second parameter to the `navigation.navigate` function: `navigation.navigate('RouteName', { /* params go here */ })`

2. Read the params in your screen component: `route.params`.

> We recommend that the params you pass are JSON-serializable. That way, you'll be able to use [state persistence](state-persistence.md) and your screen components will have the right contract for implementing [deep linking](deep-linking.md).

```js
function HomeScreen({ navigation }) {
  return (
    <View style={{ flex: 1, alignItems: 'center', justifyContent: 'center' }}>
      <Text>Home Screen</Text>
      <Button
        title="Go to Details"
        onPress={() => {
          /* 1. Navigate to the Details route with params */
          navigation.navigate('Details', {
            itemId: 86,
            otherParam: 'anything you want here',
          });
        }}
      />
    </View>
  );
}

function DetailsScreen({ route, navigation }) {
  /* 2. Get the param */
  const { itemId } = route.params;
  const { otherParam } = route.params;
  return (
    <View style={{ flex: 1, alignItems: 'center', justifyContent: 'center' }}>
      <Text>Details Screen</Text>
      <Text>itemId: {JSON.stringify(itemId)}</Text>
      <Text>otherParam: {JSON.stringify(otherParam)}</Text>
      <Button
        title="Go to Details... again"
        onPress={() =>
          navigation.push('Details', {
            itemId: Math.floor(Math.random() * 100),
          })
        }
      />
      <Button title="Go to Home" onPress={() => navigation.navigate('Home')} />
      <Button title="Go back" onPress={() => navigation.goBack()} />
    </View>
  );
}
```

![Screen with passed parameters](/docs/assets/navigators/passing_params.png)

Screens can also update their params, like they can update their state. The `navigation.setParams` method lets you update the params of a screen. Refer to the [API reference for `setParams`](navigation-prop.html#setparams---make-changes-to-route-params) for more details.

You can also pass some initial params to a screen. If you didn't specify any params when navigating to this screen, the initial params will be used. They are also shallow merged with any params that you pass. Initial params can be specified with an `initialParams` prop:

```js
<Stack.Screen
  name="Details"
  component={DetailsScreen}
  initialParams={{ itemId: 42 }}
/>
```

Params aren't only useful for passing some data to a new screen, but they can also be useful to pass data to a previous screen too. For example, let's say you have a screen with an create post button, and the create post button opens a new screen to create a post. After creating the post, you want to pass the data for the post back to previous screen.

To achieve this, you can use the `navigate` method, which acts like `goBack` if the screen already exists. You can pass the `params` with `navigate` to pass the data back:

<samp id="passing-params-back" />

```js
function HomeScreen({ navigation, route }) {
  React.useEffect(() => {
    if (route.params?.post) {
      // Post updated, do something with `route.params.post`
      // For example, send the post to the server
    }
  }, [route.params?.post]);

  return (
    <View style={{ flex: 1, alignItems: 'center', justifyContent: 'center' }}>
      <Button
        title="Create post"
        onPress={() => navigation.navigate('CreatePost')}
      />
      <Text style={{ margin: 10 }}>Post: {route.params?.post}</Text>
    </View>
  );
}

function CreatePostScreen({ navigation, route }) {
  const [postText, setPostText] = React.useState('');

  return (
    <>
      <TextInput
        multiline
        placeholder="What's on your mind?"
        style={{ height: 200, padding: 10, backgroundColor: 'white' }}
        value={postText}
        onChangeText={setPostText}
      />
      <Button
        title="Done"
        onPress={() => {
          // Pass params back to home screen
          navigation.navigate('Home', { post: postText });
        }}
      />
    </>
  );
}
```

Here, after you press "Done", the home screen's `route.params` will be updated to reflect the post text that you passed in `navigate`.

## Summary

- `navigate` and `push` accept an optional second argument to let you pass parameters to the route you are navigating to. For example: `navigation.navigate('RouteName', {paramName: 'value'})`.
- You can read the params through `route.params` inside a screen
- You can update the screen's params with `navigation.setParams`
- Initial params can be passed via the `initialParams` prop on `Screen`
