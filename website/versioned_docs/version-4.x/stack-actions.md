`StackActions` is an object containing methods for generating actions specific to stack-based navigators. Its methods expand upon the actions available in [`NavigationActions`](navigation-actions.md).

The following actions are supported:

- [Reset](#reset) - Replace current state with a new state
- [Replace](#replace) - Replace a route at a given key with another route
- [Push](#push) - Add a route on the top of the stack, and navigate forward to it
- [Pop](#pop) - Navigate back to previous routes
- [PopToTop](#poptotop) - Navigate to the top route of the stack, dismissing all other routes

### reset

The `reset` action wipes the whole navigation state and replaces it with the result of several actions.

- `index` - _number_ - required - Index of the active route on `routes` array in navigation `state`.
- `actions` - _array_ - required - Array of Navigation Actions that will replace the navigation state.
- `key` - _string or null_ - optional - If set, the navigator with the given key will reset. If null, the root navigator will reset.

```js
import { StackActions, NavigationActions } from 'react-navigation';

const resetAction = StackActions.reset({
  index: 0,
  actions: [NavigationActions.navigate({ routeName: 'Profile' })],
});
this.props.navigation.dispatch(resetAction);
```

#### How to use the `index` parameter

The `index` param is used to specify the current active route.

eg: given a basic stack navigation with two routes `Profile` and `Settings`.
To reset the state to a point where the active screen was `Settings` but have it stacked on top of a `Profile` screen, you would do the following:

```js
import { StackActions, NavigationActions } from 'react-navigation';

const resetAction = StackActions.reset({
  index: 1,
  actions: [
    NavigationActions.navigate({ routeName: 'Profile' }),
    NavigationActions.navigate({ routeName: 'Settings' }),
  ],
});
this.props.navigation.dispatch(resetAction);
```

### replace

The `replace` action replaces the route at the given key with another route.

- `key` - _string_ - Key of the route to replace. If this is not defined, the most recent route will be replaced.
- `newKey` - _string_ - Key to use for the replacement route. Generated automatically if not provided.
- `routeName` - _string_ - `routeName` to use for replacement route.
- `params` - _object_ - Parameters to pass in to the replacement route.
- `action` - _object_ - Optional sub-action.

### push

The `push` action adds a route on top of the stack and navigates forward to it. This differs from `navigate` in that `navigate` will pop back to earlier in the stack if a route of the given name is already present there. `push` will always add on top, so a route can be present multiple times.

- `routeName` - _string_ - `routeName` to push onto the stack.
- `params` - _object_ - Screen params to merge into the destination route (found in the pushed screen through `this.props.navigation.state.params`).
- `action` - (advanced) The sub-action to run in the child router, if the screen is a navigator.

```js
import { StackActions } from 'react-navigation';

const pushAction = StackActions.push({
  routeName: 'Profile',
  params: {
    myUserId: 9,
  },
});

this.props.navigation.dispatch(pushAction);
```

### pop

The `pop` action takes you back to a previous screen in the stack. The `n` param allows you to specify how many screens to pop back by.

- `n` - _number_ - The number of screens to pop back by.

```js
import { StackActions } from 'react-navigation';

const popAction = StackActions.pop({
  n: 1,
});

this.props.navigation.dispatch(popAction);
```

### popToTop

The `popToTop` action takes you back to the first screen in the stack, dismissing all the others. It's functionally identical to `StackActions.pop({n: currentIndex})`.

```js
import { StackActions } from 'react-navigation';

this.props.navigation.dispatch(StackActions.popToTop());
```
