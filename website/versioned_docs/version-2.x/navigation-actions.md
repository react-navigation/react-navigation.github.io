All `NavigationActions` return an object that can be sent to the router using `navigation.dispatch()` method.

Note that if you want to dispatch react-navigation actions you should use the action creators provided in this library.

The following actions are supported:

* [Navigate](#navigate) - Navigate to another route
* [Back](#back) - Go back to previous state
* [Set Params](#setparams) - Set Params for given route
* [Init](#init) - Used to initialize first state if state is undefined

For actions specific to a StackNavigator, see [StackActions](stack-actions.md).

The action creator functions define `toString()` to return the action type, which enables easy usage with third-party Redux libraries, including redux-actions and redux-saga.

### navigate

The `navigate` action will update the current state with the result of a `navigate` action.

* `routeName` - _String_ - Required - A destination routeName that has been registered somewhere in the app's router
* `params` - _Object_ - Optional - Params to merge into the destination route
* `action` - _Object_ - Optional - (advanced) The sub-action to run in the child router, if the screen is a navigator. Any one of the actions described in this doc can be set as a sub-action.
* `key` - _String_ - Optional - The identifier for the route to navigate to. Navigate back to this route if it already exists

```js
import { NavigationActions } from 'react-navigation';

const navigateAction = NavigationActions.navigate({
  routeName: 'Profile',

  params: {},

  action: NavigationActions.navigate({ routeName: 'SubProfileRoute' }),
});

this.props.navigation.dispatch(navigateAction);
```

### back

Go back to previous screen and close current screen. `back` action creator takes in one optional parameter:

* `key` - _string or null_ - optional - If set, navigation will go back from the given key. If null, navigation will go back anywhere.

```js
import { NavigationActions } from 'react-navigation';

const backAction = NavigationActions.back({
  key: 'Profile',
});
this.props.navigation.dispatch(backAction);
```

### setParams

When dispatching `setParams`, the router will produce a new state that has changed the params of a particular route, as identified by the key

* `params` - _object_ - required - New params to be merged into existing route params
* `key` - _string_ - required - Route key that should get the new params

```js
import { NavigationActions } from 'react-navigation';

const setParamsAction = NavigationActions.setParams({
  params: { title: 'Hello' },
  key: 'screen-123',
});
this.props.navigation.dispatch(setParamsAction);
```
