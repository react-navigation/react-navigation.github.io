Currently at the time of writing, `react-navigation@2.x` will work on most of the previous `react-native` versions, until the [lean core effort](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/23313) finally removes `AsyncStorage` out of `react-native`.

If you are using [react-native-screens](react-native-screens.html) (supported in `react-navigation@^2.14.0`), you will need to be aware of its own supported `react-native` version too.

> Please note that the statements above may not be correct for a particular `react-native` version. If you notice a version that is not working properly, feel free to either file an [issue](https://github.com/react-navigation/react-navigation.github.io/issues/new) or correct it in this page.
