How does a route find out that a user is leaving it or coming back to it?\n\nIf you are coming to react-navigation from a web background, you may assume that when user navigates from route `A` to route `B`, `A` will unmount (its `componentWillUnmount` is called) and `A` will mount again when user comes back to it. While these React lifecycle methods are still valid and are used in react-navigation, their usage differs from the web. This is driven by more complex needs of mobile navigation.\n\n## Example scenario\n\nConsider a stack navigator with screens A and B. After navigating to A, its `componentDidMount` is called. When pushing B, its `componentDidMount` is also called, but A remains mounted on the stack and its `componentWillUnmount` is therefore not called.\n\nWhen going back from B to A, `componentWillUnmount` of B is called, but `componentDidMount` of A is not because A remained mounted the whole time.\n\nSimilar results can be observed (in combination) with other navigators as well. Consider a tab navigator with two tabs, where each tab is a stack navigator:\n\n<samp id="navigation-lifecycle" />\n\n```jsx\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    <NavigationContainer>\n      <Tab.Navigator>\n        <Tab.Screen name="First">\n          {() => (\n            <SettingsStack.Navigator>\n              <SettingsStack.Screen\n                name="Settings"\n                component={SettingsScreen}\n              />\n              <SettingsStack.Screen name="Profile" component={ProfileScreen} />\n            </SettingsStack.Navigator>\n          )}\n        </Tab.Screen>\n        <Tab.Screen name="Second">\n          {() => (\n            <HomeStack.Navigator>\n              <HomeStack.Screen name="Home" component={HomeScreen} />\n              <HomeStack.Screen name="Details" component={DetailsScreen} />\n            </HomeStack.Navigator>\n          )}\n        </Tab.Screen>\n      </Tab.Navigator>\n    </NavigationContainer>\n  );\n}\n```\n\nWe start on the `HomeScreen` and navigate to `DetailsScreen`. Then we use the tab bar to switch to the `SettingsScreen` and navigate to `ProfileScreen`. After this sequence of operations is done, all 4 of the screens are mounted! If you use the tab bar to switch back to the `HomeStack`, you\'ll notice you\'ll be presented with the `DetailsScreen` - the navigation state of the `HomeStack` has been preserved!\n\n## React Navigation lifecycle events\n\nNow that we understand how React lifecycle methods work in React Navigation, let\'s answer the question we asked at the beginning: "How do we find out that a user is leaving (blur) it or coming back to it (focus)?"\n\nReact Navigation emits events to screen components that subscribe to them. We can listen to `focus` and `blur` events to know when a screen comes into focus or goes out of focus respectively.\n\nExample:\n\n<samp id="focus-and-blur" />\n\n```js\nfunction Profile({ navigation }) {\n  React.useEffect(() => {\n    const unsubscribe = navigation.addListener(\'focus\', () => {\n      // Screen was focused\n      // Do something\n    });\n\n    return unsubscribe;\n  }, [navigation]);\n\n  return <ProfileContent />;\n}\n```\n\nSee [Navigation events](navigation-events.md) for more details on the available events and the API usage.\n\nInstead of adding event listeners manually, we can use the [`useFocusEffect`](use-focus-effect.md) hook to perform side effects. It\'s like React\'s `useEffect` hook, but it ties into the navigation lifecycle.\n\nExample:\n\n<samp id="use-focus-effect" />\n\n```js\nimport { useFocusEffect } from \'@react-navigation/native\';\n\nfunction Profile() {\n  useFocusEffect(\n    React.useCallback(() => {\n      // Do something when the screen is focused\n\n      return () => {\n        // Do something when the screen is unfocused\n        // Useful for cleanup functions\n      };\n    }, [])\n  );\n\n  return <ProfileContent />;\n}\n```\n\nIf you want to render different things based on if the screen is focused or not, you can use the [`useIsFocused`](use-is-focused.md) hook which returns a boolean indicating whether the screen is focused.\n\n## Summary\n\n- While React\'s lifecycle methods are still valid, React Navigation adds more events that you can subscribe to through the `navigation` prop.\n- You may also use the `useFocusEffect` or `useIsFocused` hooks.\n'},c=void 0,r={},l=[{value:"Example scenario",id:"example-scenario",level:2},{value:"React Navigation lifecycle events",id:"react-navigation-lifecycle-events",level:2},{value:"Summary",id:"summary",level:2}];function d(e){const n={a:"a",code:"code",h2:"h2",li:"li",p:"p",pre:"pre",ul:"ul",...(0,i.R)(),...e.components};return(0,a.jsxs)(a.Fragment,{children:[(0,a.jsxs)(n.p,{children:["In a previous section, we worked with a stack navigator that has two screens (",(0,a.jsx)(n.code,{children:"Home"})," and ",(0,a.jsx)(n.code,{children:"Details"}),") and learned how to use ",(0,a.jsx)(n.code,{children:"navigation.navigate('RouteName')"})," to navigate between the routes."]}),"\n",(0,a.jsxs)(n.p,{children:["An important question in this context is: what happens with ",(0,a.jsx)(n.code,{children:"Home"})," when we navigate away from it, or when we come back to it?
