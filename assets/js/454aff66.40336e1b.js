It's useful in rare cases where you want to render something based on the navigation state.\n\n:::warning\n\nConsider the navigator's state object to be internal and subject to change in a minor release. Avoid using properties from the [navigation state](navigation-state.md) state object except `index` and `routes`, unless you really need it. If there is some functionality you cannot achieve without relying on the structure of the state object, please open an issue.\n\n:::\n\nIt takes a selector function as an argument. The selector will receive the full [navigation state](navigation-state.md) and can return a specific value from the state:\n\n```js\nconst index = useNavigationState((state) => state.index);\n```\n\nThe selector function helps to reduce unnecessary re-renders, so your screen will re-render only when that's something you care about. If you actually need the whole state object, you can do this explicitly:\n\n```js\nconst state = useNavigationState((state) => state);\n```\n\n:::warning\n\nThis hook is useful for advanced cases and it's easy to introduce performance issues if you're not careful. For most of the cases, you don't need the navigator's state.\n\n:::\n\n## How is `useNavigationState` different from `navigation.getState()`?\n\nThe `navigation.getState()` function also returns the current [navigation state](navigation-state.md). The main difference is that the `useNavigationState` hook will trigger a re-render when values change, while `navigation.getState()` won't. For example, the following code will be incorrect:\n\n```js\nfunction Profile() {\n  const routesLength = navigation.getState().routes.length; // Don't do this\n\n  return <Text>Number of routes: {routesLength}</Text>;\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, even if you push a new screen, this text won't update. If you use the hook, it'll work as expected:\n\n<samp id=\"use-navigation-state\" />\n\n```js\nfunction Profile() {\n  const routesLength = useNavigationState((state) => state.routes.length);\n\n  return <Text>Number of routes: {routesLength}</Text>;\n}\n```\n\nSo when do you use `navigation.getState()`? It's mostly useful within event listeners where you don't care about what's rendered. In most cases, using the hook should be preferred.\n\n## Using with class component\n\nYou can wrap your class component in a function component to use the hook:\n\n```js\nclass Profile extends React.Component {\n  render() {\n    // Get it from props\n    const { routesLength } = this.props;\n  }\n}\n\n// Wrap and export\nexport default function (props) {\n  const routesLength = useNavigationState((state) => state.routes.length);\n\n  return <Profile {...props} routesLength={routesLength} />;\n}\n```\n"},r=void 0,c={},u=[{value:"How is <code>useNavigationState</code> different from <code>navigation.getState()</code>?",id:"how-is-usenavigationstate-different-from-navigationgetstate",level:2},{value:"Using with class component",id:"using-with-class-component",level:2}];function h(e){const t={a:"a",admonition:"admonition",code:"code",h2:"h2",p:"p",pre:"pre",...(0,o.R)(),...e.components};return(0,s.jsxs)(s.Fragment,{children:[(0,s.jsxs)(t.p,{children:[(0,s.jsx)(t.code,{children:"useNavigationState"})," is a hook which gives access to the ",(0,s.jsx)(t.a,{href:"/docs/6.x/navigation-state",children:"navigation state"})," of the navigator which contains the screen.
