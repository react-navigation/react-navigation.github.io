It also offers basic Web support using [`react-native-web`](https://github.com/necolas/react-native-web).\n\nOne thing to keep in mind is that while `@react-navigation/native-stack` offers native performance and exposes native features such as large title on iOS etc., it may not be as customizable as [`@react-navigation/stack`](stack-navigator.md) depending on your needs. So if you need more customization than what\'s possible in this navigator, consider using `@react-navigation/stack` instead - which is a more customizable JavaScript based implementation.\n\n## Installation\n\nTo use this navigator, ensure that you have [`@react-navigation/native` and its dependencies (follow this guide)](getting-started.md), then install [`@react-navigation/native-stack`](https://github.com/react-navigation/react-navigation/tree/main/packages/native-stack):\n\n```bash npm2yarn\nnpm install @react-navigation/native-stack@next\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nTo use this navigator, import it from `@react-navigation/native-stack`:\n\n```js name="Native Stack Navigator" snack static2dynamic\nimport * as React from \'react\';\nimport { Text, View } from \'react-native\';\nimport {\n  createStaticNavigation,\n  useNavigation,\n} from \'@react-navigation/native\';\nimport { Button } from \'@react-navigation/elements\';\n// codeblock-focus-start\nimport { createNativeStackNavigator } from \'@react-navigation/native-stack\';\n\n// codeblock-focus-end\nfunction HomeScreen() {\n  const navigation = useNavigation(\'Home\');\n\n  return (\n    <View style={{ flex: 1, alignItems: \'center\', justifyContent: \'center\' }}>\n      <Text>Home Screen</Text>\n      <Button onPress={() => navigation.navigate(\'Profile\')}>\n        Go to Profile\n      </Button>\n    </View>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction ProfileScreen() {\n  return (\n    <View style={{ flex: 1, alignItems: \'center\', justifyContent: \'center\' }}>\n      <Text>Profile Screen</Text>\n    </View>\n  );\n}\n\n// codeblock-focus-start\nconst MyStack = createNativeStackNavigator({\n  screens: {\n    Home: HomeScreen,\n    Profile: ProfileScreen,\n  },\n});\n// codeblock-focus-end\n\nconst Navigation = createStaticNavigation(MyStack);\n\nexport default function App() {\n  return <Navigation />;\n}\n```\n\n:::info\n\nIf you encounter any bugs while using `createNativeStackNavigator`, please open issues on [`react-native-screens`](https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-screens) rather than the `react-navigation` repository!\n\n:::\n\n## API Definition\n\n### Props\n\nThe native stack navigator accepts the [common props](navigator.md#configuration) shared by all navigators.\n\n### Options\n\nThe following [options](screen-options.md) can be used to configure the screens in the navigator:\n\n#### `title`\n\nString that can be used as a fallback for `headerTitle`.\n\n#### `statusBarAnimation`\n\nSets the status bar animation (similar to the `StatusBar` component). Defaults to `fade` on iOS and `none` on Android.\n\nSupported values:\n\n- `"fade"`\n- `"none"`\n- `"slide"`\n\nOn Android, setting either `fade` or `slide` will set the transition of status bar color. On iOS, this option applies to the appereance animation of the status bar.\n\nRequires setting `View controller-based status bar appearance -> YES` (or removing the config) in your `Info.plist` file.\n\nOnly supported on Android and iOS.\n\n#### `statusBarHidden`\n\nWhether the status bar should be hidden on this screen.\n\nRequires setting `View controller-based status bar appearance -> YES` (or removing the config) in your `Info.plist` file.\n\nOnly supported on Android and iOS.\n\n#### `statusBarStyle`\n\nSets the status bar color (similar to the `StatusBar` component).\n\nSupported values:\n\n- `"auto"` (iOS only)\n- `"inverted"` (iOS only)\n- `"dark"`\n- `"light"`\n\nDefaults to `auto` on iOS and `light` on Android.\n\nRequires setting `View controller-based status bar appearance -> YES` (or removing the config) in your `Info.plist` file.\n\nOnly supported on Android and iOS.\n\n#### `statusBarBackgroundColor`\n\n:::warning\n\nThis option is deprecated and will be removed in a future release (for apps targeting Android SDK 35 or above edge-to-edge mode is enabled by default\nand it is expected that the edge-to-edge will be enforced in future SDKs, see [here](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/15/behavior-changes-15#ux) for more information).\n\n:::\n\nSets the background color of the status bar (similar to the `StatusBar` component).\n\nOnly supported on Android.\n\n#### `statusBarTranslucent`\n\n:::warning\n\nThis option is deprecated and will be removed in a future release (for apps targeting Android SDK 35 or above edge-to-edge mode is enabled by default\nand it is expected that the edge-to-edge will be enforced in future SDKs, see [here](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/15/behavior-changes-15#ux) for more information).\n\n:::\n\nSets the translucency of the status bar (similar to the `StatusBar` component).

This is because it is the sheet, not the parent who is source of the size. Setting fixed values for `sheetAllowedDetents`, e.g. `[0.4, 0.9]`, works correctly (content is aligned for the highest detent).\n\nOn iOS, `flex: 1` with `showAllowedDetents: \'fitToContents\'` works properly but setting a fixed value for `showAllowedDetents` causes the screen to not respect the `flex: 1` style - the height of the container does not fill the `formSheet` fully, but rather inherits intrinsic size of its contents. This tradeoff is _currently_ necessary to prevent ["sheet flickering" problem on iOS](https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-screens/issues/1722).\n\nIf you don\'t use `flex: 1` but the content\'s height is less than max screen height, the rest of the sheet might become translucent or use the default theme background color (you can see this happening on the screenshots in the descrption of [this PR](https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-screens/pull/2462)). To match the sheet to the background of your content, set `backgroundColor` in the `contentStyle` prop of the given screen.\n\nOn Android, there are also some problems with getting nested ScrollViews to work properly. The solution is to set `nestedScrollEnabled` on the `ScrollView`, but this does not work if the content\'s height is less than the `ScrollView`\'s height. Please see [this PR](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/44099) for details and suggested [workaround](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/44099#issuecomment-2058469661).\n\nOn Android, nested stack and `headerShown` prop are not currently supported for screens with `presentation: \'formSheet\'`.\n\n:::\n\n#### `sheetAllowedDetents`\n\n:::note\n\nWorks only when `presentation` is set to `formSheet`.\n\n:::\n\n<video playsInline autoPlay muted loop>\n  <source src="/assets/7.x/native-stack/formSheet-sheetAllowedDetents.mp4" />\n</video>\n\nDescribes heights where a sheet can rest.\n\nSupported values:\n\n- `fitToContents` - intents to set the sheet height to the height of its contents.\n- Array of fractions, e.g. `[0.25, 0.5, 0.75]`:\n  - Heights should be described as fraction (a number from `[0, 1]` interval) of screen height / maximum detent height.\n  - The array **must** be sorted in ascending order.

See `headerBackButtonDisplayMode` to read about limitations and customize the behavior.\n\nUse `headerBackButtonDisplayMode: "minimal"` to hide it.\n\nOnly supported on iOS.\n\n<img src="/assets/7.x/native-stack/headerBackTitle.jpeg" width="500" alt="Header back title" />\n\n#### `headerBackButtonDisplayMode`\n\nHow the back button displays icon and title.\n\nSupported values:\n\n- "default" - Displays one of the following depending on the available space: previous screen\'s title, generic title (e.g. \'Back\') or no title (only icon).\n- "generic" \u2013 Displays one of the following depending on the available space: generic title (e.g. \'Back\') or no title (only icon).\n- "minimal" \u2013 Always displays only the icon without a title.\n\nThe space-aware behavior is disabled when:\n\n- The iOS version is 13 or lower\n- Custom font family or size is set (e.g. with `headerBackTitleStyle`)\n- Back button menu is disabled (e.g. with `headerBackButtonMenuEnabled`)\n\nIn such cases, a static title and icon are always displayed.\n\nOnly supported on iOS.\n\n#### `headerBackTitleStyle`\n\nStyle object for header back title. Supported properties:\n\n- `fontFamily`\n- `fontSize`\n\nOnly supported on iOS.\n\n<img src="/assets/7.x/native-stack/headerBackTitleStyle.png" width="500" alt="Header back title style" />\n\nExample:\n\n```js\nheaderBackTitleStyle: {\n  fontSize: 14,\n  fontFamily: \'Georgia\',\n},\n```\n\n#### `headerBackIcon`\n\nIcon to display in the header as the icon in the back button.\n\nIt supports the following types:\n\n- `materialSymbol` (Android only)\n\n  ```js\n  headerBackIcon: {\n    type: \'materialSymbol\',\n    name: \'arrow_back\',\n  }\n  ```\n\n  See [Icons](icons.md#material-symbols) for more details.\n\n- `sfSymbol` (iOS only)\n\n  ```js\n  headerBackIcon: {\n    type: \'sfSymbol\',\n    name: \'arrow.left\',\n  }\n  ```\n\n  See [Icons](icons.md#sf-symbols) for more details.\n\n  This is only supported when using [`Header`](elements.md#header) from `@react-navigation/elements` as the header component. The native header doesn\'t support SF Symbols.\n\n- `image`\n\n  ```js\n  headerBackIcon: {\n    type: \'image\',\n    source: require(\'./path/to/icon.png\'),\n  }\n  ```\n\nDefaults to back icon image for the platform:\n\n- A chevron on iOS\n- An arrow on Android\n\n#### `headerLargeStyle`\n\nStyle of the header when a large title is shown. The large title is shown if `headerLargeTitleEnabled` is `true` and the edge of any scrollable content reaches the matching edge of the header.\n\nSupported properties:\n\n- backgroundColor\n\nOnly supported on iOS.\n\n<video playsInline autoPlay muted loop style={{ width: "500px" }}>\n\n  <source src="/assets/7.x/native-stack/headerLargeStyle.mp4" />\n</video>\n\n#### `headerLargeTitleEnabled`\n\nWhether to enable header with large title which collapses to regular header on scroll.\nDefaults to `false`.\n\nFor large title to collapse on scroll, the content of the screen should be wrapped in a scrollable view such as `ScrollView` or `FlatList`. If the scrollable area doesn\'t fill the screen, the large title won\'t collapse on scroll. You also need to specify `contentInsetAdjustmentBehavior="automatic"` in your `ScrollView`, `FlatList` etc.\n\nOnly supported on iOS.\n\n<video playsInline autoPlay muted loop style={{ width: "500px" }}>\n\n  <source src="/assets/7.x/native-stack/headerLargeTitle.mp4" />\n</video>\n\n#### `headerLargeTitleShadowVisible`\n\nWhether drop shadow of header is visible when a large title is shown.\n\n#### `headerLargeTitleStyle`\n\nStyle object for large title in header. Supported properties:\n\n- `fontFamily`\n- `fontSize`\n- `fontWeight`\n- `color`\n\nOnly supported on iOS.\n\n<img src="/assets/7.x/native-stack/headerLargeTitleStyle.png" width="500" alt="Header large title style" />\n\nExample:\n\n```js\n    headerLargeTitleStyle: {\n      fontFamily: \'Georgia\',\n      fontSize: 22,\n      fontWeight: \'500\',\n      color: \'blue\',\n    },\n```\n\n#### `headerStyle`\n\nStyle object for header. Supported properties:\n\n- `backgroundColor`\n\n<video playsInline autoPlay muted loop style={{ width: "500px" }}>\n\n  <source src="/assets/7.x/native-stack/headerStyle.mp4" />\n</video>\n\n#### `headerShadowVisible`\n\nWhether to hide the elevation shadow (Android) or the bottom border (iOS) on the header.\n\nAndroid:\n<img src="/assets/7.x/native-stack/headerShadowVisible-Android.png" width="500" alt="Header shadow visible Android" />\n\niOS:\n<img src="/assets/7.x/native-stack/headerShadowVisible-iOS.png" width="500" alt="Header shadow visible iOS" />\n\n#### `headerTransparent`\n\nBoolean indicating whether the navigation bar is translucent.\n\nDefaults to `false`. Setting this to `true` makes the header absolutely positioned - so that the header floats over the screen so that it overlaps the content underneath, and changes the background color to `transparent` unless specified in `headerStyle`.\n\nThis is useful if you want to render a semi-transparent header or a blurred background.\n\nNote that if you don\'t want your content to appear under the header, you need to manually add a top margin to your content. React Navigation won\'t do it automatically.\n\nTo get the height of the header, you can use [`HeaderHeightContext`](elements.md#headerheightcontext) with [React\'s Context API](https://react.dev/reference/react/useContext#contextconsumer) or [`useHeaderHeight`](elements.md#useheaderheight).\n\n#### `headerBlurEffect`\n\nBlur effect for the translucent header. The `headerTransparent` option needs to be set to `true` for this to work.\n\nSupported values:\n\n- `extraLight`\n\n- `light`\n  <img src="/assets/7.x/native-stack/headerBlurEffect-light.png" width="500" alt="Header blur effect light" />\n\n- `dark`\n  <img src="/assets/7.x/native-stack/headerBlurEffect-dark.png" width="500" alt="Header blur effect dark" />\n\n- `regular`\n  <img src="/assets/7.x/native-stack/headerBlurEffect-regular.png" width="500" alt="Header blur effect regular" />\n\n- `prominent`\n  <img src="/assets/7.x/native-stack/headerBlurEffect-systemUltraThinMaterial.png" width="500" alt="Header blur effect systemUltraThinMaterial" />\n\n- `systemUltraThinMaterial`\n  <img src="/assets/7.x/native-stack/headerBlurEffect-systemUltraThinMaterial.png" width="500" alt="Header blur effect systemUltraThinMaterial" />\n\n- `systemThinMaterial`\n  <img src="/assets/7.x/native-stack/headerBlurEffect-systemThinMaterial.png" width="500" alt="Header blur effect systemThinMaterial" />\n\n- `systemMaterial`\n  <img src="/assets/7.x/native-stack/headerBlurEffect-systemMaterial.png" width="500" alt="Header blur effect systemMaterial" />\n\n- `systemThickMaterial`\n  <img src="/assets/7.x/native-stack/headerBlurEffect-systemThickMaterial.png" width="500" alt="Header blur effect systemThickMaterial" />\n\n- `systemChromeMaterial`\n  <img src="/assets/7.x/native-stack/headerBlurEffect-systemChromeMaterial.png" width="500" alt="Header blur effect systemChromeMaterial" />\n\n- `systemUltraThinMaterialLight`\n  <img src="/assets/7.x/native-stack/headerBlurEffect-systemUltraThinMaterialLight.png" width="500" alt="Header blur effect systemUltraThinMaterialLight" />\n\n- `systemThinMaterialLight`\n  <img src="/assets/7.x/native-stack/headerBlurEffect-systemThinMaterialLight.png" width="500" alt="Header blur effect systemThinMaterialLight" />\n\n- `systemMaterialLight`\n  <img src="/assets/7.x/native-stack/headerBlurEffect-systemMaterialLight.png" width="500" alt="Header blur effect systemMaterialLight" />\n\n- `systemThickMaterialLight`\n  <img src="/assets/7.x/native-stack/headerBlurEffect-systemThickMaterialLight.png" width="500" alt="Header blur effect systemThickMaterialLight" />\n\n- `systemChromeMaterialLight`\n  <img src="/assets/7.x/native-stack/headerBlurEffect-systemChromeMaterialLight.png" width="500" alt="Header blur effect systemChromeMaterialLight" />\n\n- `systemUltraThinMaterialDark`\n  <img src="/assets/7.x/native-stack/headerBlurEffect-systemUltraThinMaterialDark.png" width="500" alt="Header blur effect systemUltraThinMaterialDark" />\n- `systemThinMaterialDark`\n  <img src="/assets/7.x/native-stack/headerBlurEffect-systemThinMaterialDark.png" width="500" alt="Header blur effect systemThinMaterialDark" />\n\n- `systemMaterialDark`\n  <img src="/assets/7.x/native-stack/headerBlurEffect-systemMaterialDark.png" width="500" alt="Header blur effect systemMaterialDark" />\n- `systemThickMaterialDark`\n  <img src="/assets/7.x/native-stack/headerBlurEffect-systemThickMaterialDark.png" width="500" alt="Header blur effect systemThickMaterialDark" />\n\n- `systemChromeMaterialDark`\n  <img src="/assets/7.x/native-stack/headerBlurEffect-systemChromeMaterialDark.png" width="500" alt="Header blur effect systemChromeMaterialDark" />\n\n:::note\n\nUsing both [`headerBlurEffect`](#headerblureffect) and `scrollEdgeEffects` (>= iOS 26) simultaneously may cause overlapping effects.\n\n:::\n\nOnly supported on iOS.\n\n#### `headerBackground`\n\nFunction which returns a React Element to render as the background of the header. This is useful for using backgrounds such as an image or a gradient.\n\n  <img src="/assets/7.x/native-stack/headerBackground.png" width="500" alt="Header background"/>\n\nExample:\n\n```js\n     headerBackground: () => (\n      <LinearGradient\n        colors={[\'#c17388\', \'#90306f\']}\n        style={{ flex: 1 }}\n        start={{ x: 0, y: 0 }}\n        end={{ x: 1, y: 0 }}\n      />\n      ),\n```\n\n#### `headerTintColor`\n\nTint color for the header.

This replaces the back button. See `headerBackVisible` to show the back button along side left element. It receives the following properties in the arguments:\n\n- `tintColor` - The tint color to apply. Defaults to the [theme](themes.md)\'s primary color.\n- `canGoBack` - Boolean indicating whether there is a screen to go back to.\n- `label` - Label text for the button. Usually the title of the previous screen.\n- `href` - The `href` to use for the anchor tag on web\n\n<img src="/assets/7.x/native-stack/headerLeft.png" width="500" alt="Header right"/>\n\nExample:\n\n```js\n    headerLeft: () => (\n      <MaterialCommunityIcons name="map" color="gray" size={36} />\n    ),\n    headerBackVisible: true,\n    headerBackTitle: \'Back\',\n```\n\n#### `headerLeftBackgroundVisible`\n\nWhether the liquid glass background is visible for the item.\n\nOnly supported on iOS 26.0 and later. Older versions of iOS and other platforms never show the background.\n\nDefaults to `true`.\n\n#### `unstable_headerLeftItems`\n\n:::warning\n\nThis option is experimental and may change in a minor release.\n\n:::\n\nFunction which returns an array of items to display as on the left side of the header. This will override `headerLeft` if both are specified. It receives the following properties in the arguments:\n\n- `tintColor` - The tint color to apply. Defaults to the [theme](themes.md)\'s primary color.\n- `canGoBack` - Boolean indicating whether there is a screen to go back to.\n\nExample:\n\n```js\nunstable_headerLeftItems: () => [\n  {\n    type: \'button\',\n    title: \'Edit\',\n    onPress: () => {\n      // Do something\n    },\n  },\n],\n```\n\nSee [Header items](#header-items) for more information.\n\nOnly supported on iOS.\n\n#### `headerRight`\n\nFunction which returns a React Element to display on the right side of the header. It receives the following properties in the arguments:\n\n- `tintColor` - The tint color to apply.

The header is shown by default. Setting this to `false` hides the header.\n\n#### `header`\n\nCustom header to use instead of the default header.\n\nThis accepts a function that returns a React Element to display as a header. The function receives an object containing the following properties as the argument:\n\n- `navigation` - The navigation object for the current screen.\n- `route` - The route object for the current screen.\n- `options` - The options for the current screen\n- `back` - Options for the back button, contains an object with a `title` property to use for back button label.\n\nExample:\n\n```js\nimport { getHeaderTitle } from \'@react-navigation/elements\';\n\n// ..\n\nheader: ({ navigation, route, options, back }) => {\n  const title = getHeaderTitle(options, route.name);\n\n  return (\n    <MyHeader\n      title={title}\n      leftButton={\n        back ? <MyBackButton onPress={navigation.goBack} /> : undefined\n      }\n      style={options.headerStyle}\n    />\n  );\n};\n```\n\nTo set a custom header for all the screens in the navigator, you can specify this option in the `screenOptions` prop of the navigator.\n\nNote that if you specify a custom header, the native functionality such as large title, search bar etc. won\'t work.\n\n### Events\n\nThe navigator can [emit events](navigation-events.md) on certain actions. Supported events are:\n\n#### `transitionStart`\n\nThis event is fired when the transition animation starts for the current screen.\n\nEvent data:\n\n- `e.data.closing` - Boolean indicating whether the screen is being opened or closed.\n\nExample:\n\n```js\nReact.useEffect(() => {\n  const unsubscribe = navigation.addListener(\'transitionStart\', (e) => {\n    // Do something\n  });\n\n  return unsubscribe;\n}, [navigation]);\n```\n\n#### `transitionEnd`\n\nThis event is fired when the transition animation ends for the current screen.\n\nEvent data:\n\n- `e.data.closing` - Boolean indicating whether the screen was opened or closed.\n\nExample:\n\n```js\nReact.useEffect(() => {\n  const unsubscribe = navigation.addListener(\'transitionEnd\', (e) => {\n    // Do something\n  });\n\n  return unsubscribe;\n}, [navigation]);\n```\n\n#### `gestureCancel`\n\nThis event is fired when the swipe back gesture is canceled. Only supported on iOS.\n\nExample:\n\n```js\nReact.useEffect(() => {\n  const unsubscribe = navigation.addListener(\'gestureCancel\', (e) => {\n    // Do something\n  });\n\n  return unsubscribe;\n}, [navigation]);\n```\n\n#### `sheetDetentChange`\n\nThis event is fired when the screen has [`presentation`](#presentation) set to `formSheet` and the sheet detent changes.\n\nEvent data:\n\n- `e.data.index` - Index of the current detent in the `sheetAllowedDetents` array.\n- `e.data.stable` - Boolean indicating whether the sheet is being dragged or settling. Only supported on Android. On iOS, this is always `true`.\n\nExample:\n\n```js\nReact.useEffect(() => {\n  const unsubscribe = navigation.addListener(\'sheetDetentChange\', (e) => {\n    // Do something\n  });\n\n  return unsubscribe;\n}, [navigation]);\n```\n\n### Helpers\n\nThe native stack navigator adds the following methods to the navigation object:\n\n#### `replace`\n\nReplaces the current screen with a new screen in the stack. The method accepts the following arguments:\n\n- `name` - _string_ - Name of the route to push onto the stack.\n- `params` - _object_ - Screen params to pass to the destination route.\n\n```js\nnavigation.replace(\'Profile\', { owner: \'Micha\u015b\' });\n```\n\n#### `push`\n\nPushes a new screen to the top of the stack and navigate to it. The method accepts the following arguments:\n\n- `name` - _string_ - Name of the route to push onto the stack.\n- `params` - _object_ - Screen params to pass to the destination route.\n\n```js\nnavigation.push(\'Profile\', { owner: \'Micha\u015b\' });\n```\n\n#### `pop`\n\nPops the current screen from the stack and navigates back to the previous screen. It takes one optional argument (`count`), which allows you to specify how many screens to pop back by.\n\n```js\nnavigation.pop();\n```\n\n#### `popTo`\n\nNavigates back to a previous screen in the stack by popping screens after it. The method accepts the following arguments:\n\n- `name` - _string_ - Name of the route to navigate to.\n- `params` - _object_ - Screen params to pass to the destination route.\n- `options` - Options object containing the following properties:\n  - `merge` - _boolean_ - Whether params should be merged with the existing route params, or replace them (when navigating to an existing screen). Defaults to `false`.\n\nIf a matching screen is not found in the stack, this will pop the current screen and add a new screen with the specified name and params.\n\n```js\nnavigation.popTo(\'Profile\', { owner: \'Micha\u015b\' });\n```\n\n#### `popToTop`\n\nPops all of the screens in the stack except the first one and navigates to it.\n\n```js\nnavigation.popToTop();\n```\n\n### Hooks\n\nThe native stack navigator exports the following hooks:\n\n#### `useAnimatedHeaderHeight`\n\nThe hook returns an animated value representing the height of the header. This is similar to [`useHeaderHeight`](elements.md#useheaderheight) but returns an animated value that changed as the header height changes, e.g. when expanding or collapsing large title or search bar on iOS.\n\nIt can be used to animated content along with header height changes.\n\n```js\nimport { Animated } from \'react-native\';\nimport { useAnimatedHeaderHeight } from \'@react-navigation/native-stack\';\n\nconst MyView = () => {\n  const headerHeight = useAnimatedHeaderHeight();\n\n  return (\n    <Animated.View\n      style={{\n        height: 100,\n        aspectRatio: 1,\n        backgroundColor: \'tomato\',\n        transform: [{ translateY: headerHeight }],\n      }}\n    />\n  );\n};\n```\n\n## Header items\n\nThe [`unstable_headerLeftItems`](#unstable_headerleftitems) and [`unstable_headerRightItems`](#unstable_headerrightitems) options allow you to add header items to the left and right side of the header respectively. This items can show native buttons, menus or custom React elements.\n\nOn iOS 26+, the header right items can also be collapsed into an overflow menu by the system when there is not enough space to show all items. Note that custom elements (with `type: \'custom\'`) won\'t be collapsed into the overflow menu.\n\n<img src="/assets/header-items/header-items.png" width="300" alt="Header items" />\n\n<img src="/assets/header-items/header-items-menu.png" width="300" alt="Header item with menu" />\n\nThere are 3 categories of items that can be displayed in the header:\n\n### Action\n\nA regular button that performs an action when pressed, or shows a menu.\n\nCommon properties:\n\n- `type`: Must be `button` or `menu`.\n- `label`: Label of the item. The label is not shown if `icon` is specified. However, it is used by screen readers, or if the header items get collapsed due to lack of space.\n- `labelStyle`: Style object for the label. Supported properties:\n  - `fontFamily`\n  - `fontSize`\n  - `fontWeight`\n  - `color`\n- `icon`: Optional icon to show instead of the label.\n\n  The icon can be an image:\n\n  ```js\n  {\n    type: \'image\',\n    source: require(\'./path/to/image.png\'),\n    tinted: true, // Whether to apply tint color to the icon. Defaults to true.\n  }\n  ```\n\n  Or a [SF Symbols](https://developer.apple.com/sf-symbols/) name:\n\n  ```js\n  {\n    type: \'sfSymbol\',\n    name: \'heart\',\n  }\n  ```\n\n- `variant`: Visual variant of the button. Supported values:\n  - `plain` (default)\n  - `done`\n  - `prominent` (iOS 26+)\n- `tintColor`: Tint color to apply to the item.\n- `disabled`: Whether the item is disabled.\n- `width`: Width of the item.\n- `hidesSharedBackground` (iOS 26+): Whether the background this item may share with other items in the bar should be hidden. Setting this to `true` hides the liquid glass background.\n- `sharesBackground` (iOS 26+): Whether this item can share a background with other items. Defaults to `true`.\n- `identifier` (iOS 26+) - An identifier used to match items across transitions.\n- `badge` (iOS 26+): An optional badge to display alongside the item. Supported properties:\n  - `value`: The value to display in the badge. It can be a string or a number.\n  - `style`: Style object for the badge. Supported properties:\n    - `fontFamily`\n    - `fontSize`\n    - `fontWeight`\n    - `color`\n    - `backgroundColor`\n- `accessibilityLabel`: Accessibility label for the item.\n- `accessibilityHint`: Accessibility hint for the item.\n\nSupported properties when `type` is `button`:\n\n- `onPress`: Function to call when the button is pressed.\n- `selected`: Whether the button is in a selected state.\n\nExample:\n\n```js\nunstable_headerRightItems: () => [\n  {\n    type: \'button\',\n    label: \'Edit\',\n    icon: {\n      type: \'sfSymbol\',\n      name: \'pencil\',\n    },\n    onPress: () => {\n      // Do something\n    },\n  },\n],\n```\n\nSupported properties when `type` is `menu`:\n\n- `changesSelectionAsPrimaryAction`: Whether the menu is a selection menu. Tapping an item in a selection menu will add a checkmark to the selected item. Defaults to `false`.\n- `menu`: An object containing the menu items. It contains the following properties:\n  - `title`: Optional title to show on top of the menu.\n  - `multiselectable`: Whether multiple items in the menu can be selected (i.e. in "on" state). Defaults to `false`.\n  - `layout`: How the menu items are displayed. Supported values:\n    - `default` (default): menu items are displayed normally.\n    - `palette`: menu items are displayed in a horizontal row.\n  - `items`: An array of menu items. A menu item can be either an `action` or a `submenu`.\n    - `action`: An object with the following properties:\n      - `type`: Must be `action`.\n      - `label`: Label of the menu item.\n      - `description`: The secondary text displayed alongside the label of the menu item.\n      - `icon`: Optional icon to show alongside the label.

Supported values:\n        - `on`\n        - `off`\n        - `mixed`\n      - `disabled`: Whether the menu item is disabled.\n      - `destructive`: Whether the menu item is styled as destructive.\n      - `hidden`: Whether the menu item is hidden.\n      - `keepsMenuPresented`: Whether to keep the menu open after selecting this item. Defaults to `false`.\n      - `discoverabilityLabel`: An elaborated title that explains the purpose of the action. On iOS, the system displays this title in the discoverability heads-up display (HUD). If this is not set, the HUD displays the label property.\n\n    - `submenu`: An object with the following properties:\n      - `type`: Must be `submenu`.\n      - `label`: Label of the submenu item.\n      - `icon`: Optional icon to show alongside the label.

By default, submenus are displayed after expanding the parent menu item. Inline menus are displayed as part of the parent menu as a section. Defaults to `false`.\n      - `layout`: How the submenu items are displayed. Supported values:\n        - `default` (default): menu items are displayed normally.\n        - `palette`: menu items are displayed in a horizontal row.\n      - `destructive`: Whether the submenu is styled as destructive.\n      - `multiselectable`: Whether multiple items in the submenu can be selected (i.e. in "on" state). Defaults to `false`.\n      - `items`: An array of menu items (can be either `action` or `submenu`).\n\nExample:\n\n```js\nunstable_headerRightItems: () => [\n  {\n    type: \'menu\',\n    label: \'Options\',\n    icon: {\n      type: \'sfSymbol\',\n      name: \'ellipsis\',\n    },\n    menu: {\n      title: \'Options\',\n      items: [\n        {\n          type: \'action\',\n          label: \'Edit\',\n          icon: {\n            type: \'sfSymbol\',\n            name: \'pencil\',\n          },\n          onPress: () => {\n            // Do something\n          },\n        },\n        {\n          type: \'submenu\',\n          label: \'More\',\n          items: [\n            {\n              type: \'action\',\n              label: \'Delete\',\n              destructive: true,\n              onPress: () => {\n                // Do something\n              },\n            },\n          ],\n        },\n      ],\n    },\n  },\n],\n```\n\n### Spacing\n\nAn item to add spacing between other items in the header.\n\nSupported properties:\n\n- `type`: Must be `spacing`.\n- `spacing`: Amount of spacing to add.\n\n```js\nunstable_headerRightItems: () => [\n  {\n    type: \'button\',\n    label: \'Edit\',\n    onPress: () => {\n      // Do something\n    },\n  },\n  {\n    type: \'spacing\',\n    spacing: 10,\n  },\n  {\n    type: \'button\',\n    label: \'Delete\',\n    onPress: () => {\n      // Do something\n    },\n  },\n],\n```\n\n### Custom\n\nA custom item to display any React Element in the header.\n\nSupported properties:\n\n- `type`: Must be `custom`.\n- `element`: A React Element to display as the item.\n- `hidesSharedBackground`: Whether the background this item may share with other items in the bar should be hidden.
