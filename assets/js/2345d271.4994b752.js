Use with caution!\n\n## Usage\n\nYou can enable persistence for your top-level navigator by rendering it with a `persistenceKey`:\n\n```js\nconst AppNavigator = createStackNavigator({...});\n\nconst App = () => <AppNavigator persistenceKey={"NavigationState"} />;\n```\n\nThis provided key will be used as the react native `AsyncStorage` key to save the JSON navigation state.\n\n### Development Mode\n\nThis feature is particularly useful in development mode. You can enable it selectively using the following approach:\n\n```js\nconst AppNavigator = createStackNavigator({...});\nconst navigationPersistenceKey = __DEV__ ? "NavigationStateDEV" : null;\nconst App = () => <AppNavigator persistenceKey={navigationPersistenceKey} />;\n```\n\n### Loading View\n\nBecause the state is persisted asynchronously, the app must render an empty/loading view for a moment while the `AsyncStorage` request completes. To customize the loading view that is rendered during this time, you can use the `renderLoadingExperimental` prop:\n\n```js\n<AppNavigator\n  persistenceKey={...}\n  renderLoadingExperimental={() => <ActivityIndicator />}\n/>\n```\n\n> Note: This API may change in the future, which is why it is labeled experimental\n\n## Warning: Serializable State\n\nEach param, route, and navigation state must be fully JSON-serializable for this feature to work. This means that your routes and params must contain no functions, class instances, or recursive data structures.\n\n## Warning: Route/Router definition changes\n\nWhen your application code changes to support new routes or different routers for a given route in your navigation state, the app may break when presented with the old navigation state.\n\nThis may happen regularly during development as you re-configure your routes and navigator hierarchy. But it also may happen in production when you release a new version of your app!\n\nThe conservative behavior is to wipe the navigation state when the app has been updated. The easiest way to do this is to refer to a different persistence key for each version that you release to users.\n\nReact Navigation uses React\'s `componentDidCatch` functionality to attempt to mitigate crashes caused by route definition changes, but this is considered experimental and may not catch all errors.\n'},o=void 0,c={},l=[{value:"Usage",id:"usage",level:2},{value:"Development Mode",id:"development-mode",level:3},{value:"Loading View",id:"loading-view",level:3},{value:"Warning: Serializable State",id:"warning-serializable-state",level:2},{value:"Warning: Route/Router definition changes",id:"warning-routerouter-definition-changes",level:2}];function p(e){const t={blockquote:"blockquote",code:"code",h2:"h2",h3:"h3",p:"p",pre:"pre",...(0,s.R)(),...e.components};return(0,i.jsxs)(i.Fragment,{children:[(0,i.jsx)(t.p,{children:"You may want to save the user's location in the app, so that they are immediately returned to the same location after the app is restarted."}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.p,{children:"This is especially valuable during development because it allows the developer to stay on the same screen when they refresh the app."}),"\n",(0,i.jsxs)(t.blockquote,{children:["\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Note: This feature is currently considered experimental, because of the warnings listed at the end of this page.
