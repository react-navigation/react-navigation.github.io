On iOS the stack navigator can also be configured to a modal style where screens slide in from the bottom.\n\nTo use this navigator, ensure that you have [react-navigation and its dependencies installed](getting-started.md), then install [`react-navigation-stack`](https://github.com/react-navigation/react-navigation/tree/4.x/packages/stack).\n\n```bash npm2yarn\nnpm install react-navigation-stack @react-native-community/masked-view\n```\n\n## API Definition\n\n```js\nimport { createStackNavigator } from 'react-navigation-stack';\n\ncreateStackNavigator(RouteConfigs, StackNavigatorConfig);\n```\n\n### RouteConfigs\n\nThe route configs object is a mapping from route name to a route config, which tells the navigator what to present for that route.\n\n```js\ncreateStackNavigator({\n  // For each screen that you can navigate to, create a new entry like this:\n  Profile: {\n    // `ProfileScreen` is a React component that will be the main content of the screen.\n    screen: ProfileScreen,\n    // When `ProfileScreen` is loaded by the StackNavigator, it will be given a `navigation` prop.\n\n    // Optional: When deep linking or using react-navigation in a web app, this path is used:\n    path: 'people/:name',\n    // The action and route params are extracted from the path.\n\n    // Optional: Override the `navigationOptions` for the screen\n    navigationOptions: ({ navigation }) => ({\n      title: `${navigation.state.params.name}'s Profile'`,\n    }),\n  },\n\n  ...MyOtherRoutes,\n});\n```\n\n### StackNavigatorConfig\n\nOptions for the router:\n\n- `initialRouteName` - Sets the default screen of the stack. Must match one of the keys in route configs.\n- `initialRouteParams` - The params for the initial route\n- `initialRouteKey` - Optional identifier of the initial route\n- `navigationOptions` - Navigation options for the navigator itself, to configure a parent navigator\n- `defaultNavigationOptions` - Default navigation options to use for screens\n- `paths` - A mapping of overrides for the paths set in the route configs\n- `detachInactiveScreens` - Boolean used to indicate whether inactive screens should be detached from the view hierarchy to save memory. Make sure to call `enableScreens` from [react-native-screens](https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-screens) to make it work. Defaults to `true` on Android and `false` on iOS.\n\nVisual options:\n\n- `mode` - Defines the style for rendering and transitions:\n  - `card` - Use the standard iOS and Android screen transitions. This is the default.\n  - `modal` - This does few things:\n    - Sets `headerMode` to `screen` for the stack unless specified\n    - Prevents last inactive screen from being detached so that it stays visible underneath the active screen\n    - Make the screens slide in from the bottom on iOS which is a common iOS pattern.\n- `headerMode` - Specifies how the header should be rendered:\n  - `float` - The header is rendered above the screen and animates independently of the screen. This is default on iOS for non-modals.\n  - `screen` - The header is rendered as part of the screen and animates together with the screen. This is default on other platforms.\n  - `none` - No header will be rendered.\n- `keyboardHandlingEnabled` - If `false`, the on screen keyboard will NOT automatically dismiss when navigating to a new screen. Defaults to `true`.\n\n### `navigationOptions` for screens inside of the navigator\n\n#### `title`\n\nString that can be used as a fallback for `headerTitle`. Additionally, will be used as a fallback for `tabBarLabel` (if nested in a TabNavigator) or `drawerLabel` (if nested in a DrawerNavigator).\n\n#### `detachPreviousScreen`\n\nBoolean used to indicate whether to detach the previous screen from the view hierarchy to save memory. Set it to `false` if you need the previous screen to be seen through the active screen. Only applicable if `detachInactiveScreens` isn't set to `false`. Defaults to `false` for the last screen when `mode='modal'`, otherwise `true`.\n\n#### `header`\n\nFunction that given `HeaderProps` returns a React Element, to display as a header.\n\nExample:\n\n```js\nheader: ({ scene, previous, navigation }) => {\n  const { options } = scene.descriptor;\n  const title =\n    options.headerTitle !== undefined\n      ? options.headerTitle\n      : options.title !== undefined\n        ? options.title\n        : scene.route.routeName;\n\n  return (\n    <MyHeader\n      title={title}\n      leftButton={\n        previous ? <MyBackButton onPress={navigation.goBack} /> : undefined\n      }\n      style={options.headerStyle}\n    />\n  );\n};\n```\n\nTo set a custom header for all the screens in the navigator, you can specify this option in the `defaultNavigationOptions` option of the navigator.\n\nWhen using a custom header, there are 2 important things to keep in mind:\n\n##### Specify a `height` in `headerStyle`\n\nIf your header's height differs from the default header height, then you might notice glitches due to measurement being async. Explicitly specifying the height will avoid such glitches.\n\nExample:\n\n```js\nheaderStyle: {\n  height: 80, // Specify the height of your custom header\n};\n```\n\nNote that this style is not applied to the header by default since you control the styling of your custom header. If you also want to apply this style to your header, use `scene.descriptor.options.headerStyle` from the props.\n\n##### Set `headerMode` to `screen`\n\nBy default, there is one floating header which renders headers for multiple screens on iOS. These headers include animations to smoothly switch to one another.\n\nSetting the `headerMode` prop to `screen` makes the header part of the screen, so you don't have to implement animations to animate it separately.\n\nIf you want to customize how the header animates and want to keep `headerMode` as `float`, you can interpolate on the `scene.progress.current` and `scene.progress.next` props. For example, following will cross-fade the header:\n\n```js\nconst progress = Animated.add(scene.progress.current, scene.progress.next || 0);\n\nconst opacity = progress.interpolate({\n  inputRange: [0, 1, 2],\n  outputRange: [0, 1, 0],\n});\n\nreturn (\n  <Animated.View style={{ opacity }}>{/* Header content */}</Animated.View>\n);\n```\n\n#### `headerShown`\n\nWhether to show or hide the header for the screen. The header is shown by default unless `headerMode` was set to `none`. Setting this to `false` hides the header.\n\nWhen hiding the header on specific screens, you might also want to set `headerMode` option to `screen`.\n\n#### `headerTitle`\n\nString or a function that returns a React Element to be used by the header. Defaults to scene `title`. When a function is specified, it receives an object containing `allowFontScaling`, `style` and `children` properties. The `children` property contains the title string.\n\n#### `headerTitleAlign`\n\nHow to align the header title. Possible values:\n\n- `left`\n- `center`\n\nDefaults to `center` on iOS and `left` on Android.\n\n#### `headerTitleAllowFontScaling`\n\nWhether header title font should scale to respect Text Size accessibility settings. Defaults to false.\n\n#### `headerBackAllowFontScaling`\n\nWhether back button title font should scale to respect Text Size accessibility settings. Defaults to false.\n\n#### `headerBackAccessibilityLabel`\n\nAccessibility label for the header back button.\n\n#### `headerBackImage`\n\nFunction which returns a React Element to display custom image in header's back button. When a function is used, it receives the `tintColor` in it's argument object. Defaults to Image component with `react-navigation/views/assets/back-icon.png` back image source, which is the default back icon image for the platform (a chevron on iOS and an arrow on Android).\n\n#### `headerBackTitle`\n\nTitle string used by the back button on iOS. Defaults to the previous scene's `headerTitle`.\n\n#### `headerBackTitleVisible`\n\nA reasonable default is supplied for whether the back button title should be visible or not, but if you want to override that you can use `true` or `false` in this option.\n\n#### `headerTruncatedBackTitle`\n\nTitle string used by the back button when `headerBackTitle` doesn't fit on the screen. `\"Back\"` by default.\n\n#### `headerRight`\n\nFunction which returns a React Element to display on the right side of the header.\n\n#### `headerLeft`\n\nFunction which returns a React Element to display on the left side of the header. When a function is used, it receives a number of arguments when rendered (`onPress`, `label`, `labelStyle` and more - check [types.tsx](https://github.com/react-navigation/react-navigation/blob/4.x/packages/stack/src/types.tsx) for the complete list).\n\n#### `headerStyle`\n\nStyle object for the header. You can specify a custom background color here, for example.\n\n#### `headerTitleStyle`\n\nStyle object for the title component\n\n#### `headerBackTitleStyle`\n\nStyle object for the back title\n\n#### `headerLeftContainerStyle`\n\nCustomize the style for the container of the `headerLeft` component, for example to add padding.\n\n#### `headerRightContainerStyle`\n\nCustomize the style for the container of the `headerRight` component, for example to add padding.\n\n#### `headerTitleContainerStyle`\n\nCustomize the style for the container of the `headerTitle` component, for example to add padding.\n\nBy default, `headerTitleContainerStyle` is with an absolute position style and offsets both `left` and `right`. This may lead to white space or overlap between `headerLeft` and `headerTitle` if a customized `headerLeft` is used. It can be solved by adjusting `left` and `right` style in `headerTitleContainerStyle` and `marginHorizontal` in `headerTitleStyle`.\n\n#### `headerTintColor`\n\nTint color for the header\n\n#### `headerPressColorAndroid`\n\nColor for material ripple (Android >= 5.0 only)\n\n#### `headerTransparent`\n\nDefaults to `false`. If `true`, the header will not have a background unless you explicitly provide it with `headerBackground`. The header will also float over the screen so that it overlaps the content underneath.\n\nThis is useful if you want to render a semi-transparent header or a blurred background.\n\nNote that if you don't want your content to appear under the header, you need to manually add a top margin to your content. React Navigation won't do it automatically.\n\nTo get the height of the header, you can use `HeaderHeightContext` with [React's Context API](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html#contextconsumer) or `useHeaderHeight`:\n\n```js\nimport { HeaderHeightContext } from 'react-navigation-stack';\n\n// ...\n\n<HeaderHeightContext.Consumer>\n  {headerHeight => (\n    /* render something */\n  )}\n</HeaderHeightContext.Consumer>\n```\n\nor\n\n```js\nimport { useHeaderHeight } from 'react-navigation-stack';\n\n// ...\n\nconst headerHeight = useHeaderHeight();\n```\n\n#### `headerBackground`\n\nFunction which returns a React Element to render as the background of the header. This is useful for using backgrounds such as an image or a gradient.\n\nFor example, you can use this with `headerTransparent` to render a blur view to create a translucent header.\n\n```js\nimport { BlurView } from 'expo-blur';\n\n// ...\n\nMyScreen.navigationOptions = {\n  headerTransparent: true,\n  headerBackground: () => (\n    <BlurView tint=\"light\" intensity={100} style={StyleSheet.absoluteFill} />\n  ),\n};\n```\n\n#### `headerStatusBarHeight`\n\nExtra padding to add at the top of header to account for translucent status bar. By default, it uses the top value from the safe area insets of the device. Pass 0 or a custom value to disable the default behavior, and customize the height.\n\n#### `cardShadowEnabled`\n\nUse this prop to have visible shadows during transitions. Defaults to `true`.\n\n#### `cardOverlayEnabled`\n\nUse this prop to have a semi-transparent dark overlay visible under the card during transitions. Defaults to `true` on Android and `false` on iOS.\n\n#### `cardStyle`\n\nStyle object for the card in stack. You can provide a custom background color to use instead of the default background here.\n\nYou can also specify `{ backgroundColor: 'transparent' }` to make the previous screen visible underneath. This is useful to implement things like modal dialogs. You should also specify `mode: 'modal'` in the stack view config when using a transparent background so previous screens aren't detached and stay visible underneath.\n\n#### `animationEnabled`\n\nWhether transition animation should be enabled the screen. If you set it to `false`, the screen won't animate when pushing or popping. Defaults to `true`.\n\n#### `animationTypeForReplace`\n\nThe type of animation to use when this screen replaces another screen. It takes the following values:\n\n- `push` - The animation of a new screen being pushed will be used\n- `pop` - The animation of a screen being popped will be used\n\nDefaults to `push`.\n\nWhen `pop` is used, the `pop` animation is applied to the screen being replaced.\n\n#### `gestureEnabled`\n\nWhether you can use gestures to dismiss this screen. Defaults to `true` on iOS, `false` on Android.\n\n#### `gestureResponseDistance`\n\nObject to override the distance of touch start from the edge of the screen to recognize gestures. It takes the following properties:\n\n- `horizontal` - _number_ - Distance for horizontal direction. Defaults to 25.\n- `vertical` - _number_ - Distance for vertical direction. Defaults to 135.\n\n#### `gestureVelocityImpact`\n\nNumber which determines the relevance of velocity for the gesture. Defaults to 0.3.\n\n#### `gestureDirection`\n\nDirection of the gestures. Refer the [Animations section](#animations) for details.\n\n#### `transitionSpec`\n\nConfiguration object for the screen transition. Refer the [Animations section](#animations) for details.\n\n#### `cardStyleInterpolator`\n\nInterpolated styles for various parts of the card. Refer the [Animations section](#animations) for details.\n\n#### `headerStyleInterpolator`\n\nInterpolated styles for various parts of the header. Refer the [Animations section](#animations) for details.\n\n#### `safeAreaInsets`\n\nSafe area insets for the screen. This is used to avoid elements like notch and status bar. By default, the device's safe area insets are automatically detected. You can override the behavior with this option.\n\nTakes an object containing following optional properties: `top`, `right`, `bottom` and `left`.\n\n#### `onTransitionStart`\n\nCallback which is called when a transition animation starts (both when screen appears and hides).\n\n#### `onTransitionEnd`\n\nCallback which is called when a transition animation ends.\n\n### `params`\n\nYou can provide default params inside route definitions:\n\n```js\nconst Store = createStackNavigator({\n  Playstation: { screen: ProductScreen, params: { product: 'Playstation' } },\n  Xbox: { screen: ProductScreen, params: { product: 'Xbox' } },\n});\n```\n\n### Examples\n\nSee the examples in the [example app](https://github.com/react-navigation/stack/tree/master/example) in the repo.\n\n### Animations\n\n### Animation related options\n\nStack Navigator exposes various options to configure the transition animation when a screen is added or removed. These transition animations can be customized on a per-screen basis by specifying the options in the `options` prop for each screen.\n\n- `gestureDirection` - The direction of swipe gestures:\n  - `horizontal` - The gesture to close the screen will start from the left, and from the right in RTL. For animations, screen will slide from the right with `SlideFromRightIOS`, and from the left in RTL.\n  - `horizontal-inverted` - The gesture to close the screen will start from the right, and from the left in RTL. For animations, screen will slide from the left with `SlideFromRightIOS`, and from the right in RTL as the direction is inverted.\n  - `vertical` - The gesture to close the screen will start from the top. For animations, screen will slide from the bottom.\n  - `vertical-inverted` - The gesture to close the screen will start from the bottom. For animations, screen will slide from the top.\n\n  You may want to specify a matching horizontal/vertical animation along with `gestureDirection` as well. For the animations included in the library, if you set `gestureDirection` to one of the inverted ones, it'll also flip the animation direction.\n\n- `transitionSpec` - An object which specifies the animation type (`timing` or `spring`) and their options (such as `duration` for `timing`). It takes 2 properties:\n  - `open` - Configuration for the transition when adding a screen\n  - `close` - Configuration for the transition when removing a screen.\n\n  Each of the object should specify 2 properties:\n  - `animation` - The animation function to use for the animation. Supported values are `timing` and `spring`.\n  - `config` - The configuration object for the timing function. For `timing`, it can be `duration` and `easing`. For `spring`, it can be `stiffness`, `damping`, `mass`, `overshootClamping`, `restDisplacementThreshold` and `restSpeedThreshold`.\n\n  A config which uses spring animation looks like this:\n\n  ```js\n  const config = {\n    animation: 'spring',\n    config: {\n      stiffness: 1000,\n      damping: 500,\n      mass: 3,\n      overshootClamping: true,\n      restDisplacementThreshold: 0.01,\n      restSpeedThreshold: 0.01,\n    },\n  };\n  ```\n\n  We can pass this function in `transitionSpec` option:\n\n  ```js\n  Profile.navigationOptions = {\n    transitionSpec: {\n      open: config,\n      close: config,\n    },\n  };\n  ```\n\n- `cardStyleInterpolator` - This is a function which specifies interpolated styles for various parts of the card. Is expected to return at least empty object, possibly containing interpolated styles for container, the card itself, overlay and shadow. Supported properties are:\n  - `containerStyle` - Style for the container view wrapping the card.\n  - `cardStyle` - Style for the view representing the card.\n  - `overlayStyle` - Style for the view representing the semi-transparent overlay below\n  - `shadowStyle` - Style for the view representing the card shadow.\n\n  The function receives the following properties in it's argument:\n  - `current` - Values for the current screen:\n    - `progress` - Animated node representing the progress value of the current screen. `0` when screen should start coming into view, `0.5` when it's mid-way, `1` when it should be fully in view.\n  - `next` - Values for the current screen the screen after this one in the stack. This can be `undefined` in case the screen animating is the last one.\n    - `progress` - Animated node representing the progress value of the next screen.\n  - `index` - The index of the card in the stack.\n  - `closing` - Animated node representing whether the card is closing. `1` when closing, `0` if not.\n  - `layouts` - Layout measurements for various items we use for animation.\n    - `screen` - Layout of the whole screen. Contains `height` and `width` properties.\n\n  A config which just fades the card looks like this:\n\n  ```js\n  const forFade = ({ current, closing }) => ({\n    cardStyle: {\n      opacity: current.progress,\n    },\n  });\n  ```\n\n  We can pass this function in `cardStyleInterpolator` option:\n\n  ```js\n  Profile.navigationOptions = {\n    cardStyleInterpolator: forFade,\n  };\n  ```\n\n- `headerStyleInterpolator` - This is a function which specifies interpolated styles for various parts of the header. Is expected to return at least empty object, possibly containing interpolated styles for left label and button, right button, title and background. Supported properties are:\n  - `leftLabelStyle` - Style for the label of the left button (back button label).\n  - `leftButtonStyle` - Style for the left button (usually the back button).\n  - `rightButtonStyle` - Style for the right button.\n  - `titleStyle` - Style for the header title text.\n  - `backgroundStyle` - Style for the header background.\n\n  The function receives the following properties in it's argument:\n  - `current` - Values for the current screen (the screen which owns this header).\n    - `progress` - Animated node representing the progress value of the current screen.\n  - `next` - Values for the current screen the screen after this one in the stack. This can be `undefined` in case the screen animating is the last one.\n    - `progress` - Animated node representing the progress value of the next screen.\n  - `layouts` - Layout measurements for various items we use for animation. Each layout object contain `height` and `width` properties.\n    - `screen` - Layout of the whole screen.\n    - `title` - Layout of the title element. Might be `undefined` when not rendering a title.\n    - `leftLabel` - Layout of the back button label. Might be `undefined` when not rendering a back button label.\n\n  A config which just fades the elements looks like this:\n\n  ```js\n  const forFade = ({ current, next }) => {\n    const opacity = Animated.add(\n      current.progress,\n      next ? next.progress : 0\n    ).interpolate({\n      inputRange: [0, 1, 2],\n      outputRange: [0, 1, 0],\n    });\n\n    return {\n      leftButtonStyle: { opacity },\n      rightButtonStyle: { opacity },\n      titleStyle: { opacity },\n      backgroundStyle: { opacity },\n    };\n  };\n  ```\n\n  We can pass this function in `headerStyleInterpolator` option:\n\n  ```js\n  Profile.navigationOptions = {\n    headerStyleInterpolator: forFade,\n  };\n  ```\n\n### Pre-made configs\n\nWith these options, it's possible to build custom transition animations for screens. We also export various configs from the library with ready-made animations which you can use:\n\n#### `TransitionSpecs`\n\n- `TransitionIOSSpec` - Exact values from UINavigationController's animation configuration.\n- `FadeInFromBottomAndroidSpec` - Configuration for activity open animation from Android Nougat.\n- `FadeOutToBottomAndroidSpec` - Configuration for activity close animation from Android Nougat.\n- `RevealFromBottomAndroidSpec` - Approximate configuration for activity open animation from Android Pie.\n\n```js\nimport { TransitionSpecs } from 'react-navigation-stack';\n\n// ...\n\nstatic navigationOptions = {\n  title: 'Profile',\n  transitionSpec: {\n    open: TransitionSpecs.TransitionIOSSpec,\n    close: TransitionSpecs.TransitionIOSSpec,\n  },\n}\n```\n\n#### `CardStyleInterpolators`\n\n- `forHorizontalIOS` - Standard iOS-style slide in from the right.\n- `forVerticalIOS` - Standard iOS-style slide in from the bottom (used for modals).\n- `forModalPresentationIOS` - Standard iOS-style modal animation in iOS 13.\n- `forFadeFromBottomAndroid` - Standard Android-style fade in from the bottom for Android Oreo.\n- `forRevealFromBottomAndroid` - Standard Android-style reveal from the bottom for Android Pie.\n\nExample configuration for Android Oreo style vertical screen fade animation:\n\n```js\nimport { CardStyleInterpolators } from 'react-navigation-stack';\n\n// ...\n\nstatic navigationOptions = {\n  title: 'Profile',\n  cardStyleInterpolator: CardStyleInterpolators.forFadeFromBottomAndroid,\n}\n```\n\n#### `HeaderStyleInterpolators`\n\n- `forUIKit` - Standard UIKit style animation for the header where the title fades into the back button label.\n- `forFade` - Simple fade animation for the header elements.\n- `forStatic` - Simple translate animation to translate the header along with the sliding screen.\n\nExample configuration for default iOS animation for header elements where the title fades into the back button:\n\n```js\nimport { HeaderStyleInterpolators } from 'react-navigation-stack';\n\n// ...\n\nstatic navigationOptions = {\n  title: 'Profile',\n  headerStyleInterpolator: HeaderStyleInterpolators.forUIKit,\n}\n```\n\n> Note: Always define your animation configuration at the top-level of the file to ensure that the references don't change across re-renders. This is important for smooth and reliable transition animations.\n\n#### `TransitionPresets`\n\nWe export various transition presets which bundle various set of these options together to match certain native animations. A transition preset is an object containing few animation related screen options exported under `TransitionPresets`. Currently the following presets are available:\n\n- `SlideFromRightIOS` - Standard iOS navigation transition.\n- `ModalSlideFromBottomIOS` - Standard iOS navigation transition for modals.\n- `ModalPresentationIOS` - Standard iOS modal presentation style (introduced in iOS 13).\n- `FadeFromBottomAndroid` - Standard Android navigation transition when opening or closing an Activity on Android < 9 (Oreo).\n- `RevealFromBottomAndroid` - Standard Android navigation transition when opening or closing an Activity on Android >= 9 (Pie).\n- `DefaultTransition` - Default navigation transition for the current platform.\n- `ModalTransition` - Default modal transition for the current platform.\n\nYou can spread these presets in `navigationOptions` to customize the animation for a screen:\n\n```js\nimport { TransitionPresets } from 'react-navigation-stack';\n\n// ...\n\nstatic navigationOptions = {\n  title: 'Profile',\n  ...TransitionPresets.ModalSlideFromBottomIOS\n}\n```\n\nIf you want to customize the transition animations for all of the screens in the navigator, you can specify it in `defaultNavigationOptions` when defining a navigator.\n\nExample configuration for iOS modal presentation style:\n\n```js\nimport { TransitionPresets } from 'react-navigation-stack';\n\n// ...\n\nconst Stack = createStackNavigator(\n  {\n    Home,\n    Profile,\n    Settings,\n  },\n  {\n    mode: 'modal',\n    headerMode: 'none',\n    defaultNavigationOptions: {\n      gestureEnabled: true,\n      cardOverlayEnabled: true,\n      ...TransitionPresets.ModalPresentationIOS,\n    },\n  }\n);\n```\n"},d=void 0,c={},h=[{value:"API
