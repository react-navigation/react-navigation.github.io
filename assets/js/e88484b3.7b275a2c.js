More information on how to set this up in other projects will follow in the future, help on documenting it is also welcome!\n\n# With standard web tools\n\nThis approach requires that you rebuild the navigation views for your app (at least until the community builds out an alternative), but allows you to leverage routers and simple navigators that don\'t require views, like the switch navigator.\n\nTo set up a navigator in a React app, [(such as one created with create-react-app)](https://github.com/react-navigation/example-web):\n\n```js\nimport { createSwitchNavigator } from \'@react-navigation/core\';\nimport { createBrowserApp } from \'@react-navigation/web\';\n\nconst MyNavigator = createSwitchNavigator(routes);\n\nconst App = createBrowserApp(MyNavigator);\n\n// now you can render "App" normally\n```\n\n## Web Links\n\nWe ship a utility out of the box which automatically sets up an `<a>` tag for you with the correct `href`.\n\nThis is necessary to properly support server rendering, critical for accessibility, and nice to provide a good user experience when the browser displays what URL the link will go to.\n\nWhen the app is running, the default browser behavior will be blocked and a navigation action will be dispatched instead.\n\nTo render a link to the "Profile" route:\n\n```js\n<Link toRoute="Profile" params={{ name: \'jamie\' }}>\n  Jamie\'s Profile\n</Link>\n```\n\nDepending on the `path` that is set up for the `Profile` route, the above link may render to html as `<a href="/people/jamie">Jamie\'s Profile</a>`\n\nYou can alternatively provide an `action` prop to the `Link`, to specify the exact navigation action that will be used to handle this link.\n\n## Server rendering\n\nYou can use the `handleServerRequest` function to get the top-level navigation prop for your app, as well as the current title for this route.\n\n```js\nexpressApp.get(\'/*\', (req, res) => {\n  const { path, query } = req;\n\n  const { navigation, title, options } = handleServerRequest(\n    AppNavigator.router,\n    path,\n    query\n  );\n\n  const markup = renderToString(<AppNavigator navigation={navigation} />);\n\n  res.send(\n    `<!doctype html>\n  <html lang="">\n  <head>\n    <title>${title}</title>\n    <script src="main.js"><\/script>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <div id="root">${markup}</div>\n  </body>\n</html>`\n  );\n});\n```\n\nFor a full example, [see a full server+client React web app here](https://github.com/react-navigation/web-server-example)\n\n## Custom navigators for the web\n\nThe built-in navigator components such as Stack are often not well suited for web sites, so you may want to create custom navigators yourself.\n\nYour view can use `props.descriptors` to see the current set of screens, get their navigation object, and see the current navigation options. You should use `SceneView` to present your child screen components.\n\nSee ["Custom Navigators"](custom-navigators.md) for more details.\n\nFor an example of this, see how the custom `SidebarView` and `AppView` are used from [`App.js` in the web server example](https://github.com/react-navigation/web-server-example/blob/master/src/App.js).\n'},s="With react-native-web",c={},l=[{value:"Web Links",id:"web-links",level:2},{value:"Server rendering",id:"server-rendering",level:2},{value:"Custom navigators for the web",id:"custom-navigators-for-the-web",level:2}];function h(e){const t={a:"a",blockquote:"blockquote",code:"code",h1:"h1",h2:"h2",header:"header",p:"p",pre:"pre",...(0,a.R)(),...e.components};return(0,o.jsxs)(o.Fragment,{children:[(0,o.jsxs)(t.blockquote,{children:["\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Note: starting in v3, React Navigation has built-in support for use in web sites, including server rendering.
