The prop contains various convenience functions that dispatch navigation actions. It looks like this:\n\n- `navigation`\n  - `navigate` - go to the given screen, this will behave differently based on the navigator\n  - `goBack` - go back to the previous screen, this will pop the current screen when used in a stack\n  - `reset` - replace the navigation state of the navigator with the given state\n  - `setParams` - merge new params onto the route's params\n  - `dispatch` - send an action object to update the [navigation state](navigation-state.md)\n  - `setOptions` - update the screen's options\n  - `isFocused` - check whether the screen is focused\n  - `canGoBack` - check whether it's possible to go back from the current screen\n  - `getState` - get the navigation state of the navigator\n  - `getParent` - get the navigation object of the parent screen, if any\n  - `addListener` - subscribe to events for the screen\n  - `removeListener` - unsubscribe from events for the screen\n\nIt's important to highlight the `navigation` prop is _not_ passed in to _all_ components; only `screen` components receive this prop automatically! React Navigation doesn't do any magic here. For example, if you were to define a `MyBackButton` component and render it as a child of a screen component, you would not be able to access the `navigation` prop on it. If, however, you wish to access the `navigation` prop in any of your components, you may use the [`useNavigation`](use-navigation.md) hook.\n\n> `setParams`/`setOptions` etc. should only be called in `useEffect`/`useLayoutEffect`/`componentDidMount`/`componentDidUpdate` etc. Not during render or in constructor.\n\n## Navigator-dependent functions\n\nThere are several additional functions present on `navigation` prop based on the kind of the current navigator.\n\nIf the navigator is a stack navigator, several alternatives to `navigate` and `goBack` are provided and you can use whichever you prefer. The functions are:\n\n- `navigation`\n  - `replace` - replace the current screen with a new one\n  - `push` - push a new screen onto the stack\n  - `pop` - go back in the stack\n  - `popToTop` - go to the top of the stack\n\nSee [Stack navigator helpers](stack-navigator.md#helpers) and [Native Stack navigator helpers](native-stack-navigator.md#helpers) for more details on these methods.\n\nIf the navigator is a tab navigator, the following are also available:\n\n- `navigation`\n  - `jumpTo` - go to a specific screen in the tab navigator\n\nSee [Bottom Tab navigator helpers](bottom-tab-navigator.md#helpers), [Material Top Tab navigator helpers](material-top-tab-navigator.md#helpers) and [Material Bottom Tab navigator helpers](material-bottom-tab-navigator.md#helpers) for more details on these methods.\n\nIf the navigator is a drawer navigator, the following are also available:\n\n- `navigation`\n  - `jumpTo` - go to a specific screen in the drawer navigator\n  - `openDrawer` - open the drawer\n  - `closeDrawer` - close the drawer\n  - `toggleDrawer` - toggle the state, ie. switch from closed to open and vice versa\n\nSee [Drawer navigator helpers](drawer-navigator.md#helpers) for more details on these methods.\n\n## Common API reference\n\nThe vast majority of your interactions with the `navigation` prop will involve `navigate`, `goBack`, and `setParams`.\n\n### `navigate`\n\nThe `navigate` method lets us navigate to another screen in your app. It takes the following arguments:\n\n`navigation.navigate(name, params)`\n\n- `name` - A destination name of the route that has been defined somewhere\n- `params` - Params to pass to the destination route.\n\n<samp id=\"navigate\" />\n\n```js\nfunction HomeScreen({ navigation: { navigate } }) {\n  return (\n    <View>\n      <Text>This is the home screen of the app</Text>\n      <Button\n        onPress={() =>\n          navigate('Profile', { names: ['Brent', 'Satya', 'Micha\u015b'] })\n        }\n        title=\"Go to Brent's profile\"\n      />\n    </View>\n  );\n}\n```\n\nIn a [native stack navigator](native-stack-navigator.md), calling `navigate` with a screen name will result in different behavior based on if the screen is already present or not. If the screen is already present in the stack's history, it'll go back to that screen and remove any screens after that. If the screen is not present, it'll push a new screen.\n\nFor example, if you have a stack with the history `Home > Profile > Settings` and you call `navigate(Profile)`, the resulting screens will be `Home > Profile` as it goes back to `Profile` and removes the `Settings` screen.\n\nBy default, the screen is identified by its name. But you can also customize it to take the params into account by using the [`getId`](screen.md#getid) prop.\n\nFor example, say you have specified a `getId` prop for `Profile` screen:\n\n```js\n<Tab.Screen\n  name={Profile}\n  component={ProfileScreen}\n  getId={({ params }) => params.userId}\n/>\n```\n\nNow, if you have a stack with the history `Home > Profile (userId: bob) > Settings` and you call `navigate(Profile, { userId: 'alice' })`, the resulting screens will be `Home > Profile (userId: bob) > Settings > Profile (userId: alice)` since it'll add a new `Profile` screen as no matching screen was found.\n\n### `goBack`\n\nThe `goBack` method lets us go back to the previous screen in the navigator.\n\nBy default, `goBack` will go back from the screen that it is called from:\n\n<samp id=\"navigate\" />\n\n```js\nfunction ProfileScreen({ navigation: { goBack } }) {\n  return (\n    <View>\n      <Button onPress={() => goBack()} title=\"Go back from ProfileScreen\" />\n    </View>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n#### Going back from a specific screen\n\nConsider the following navigation stack history:\n\n```javascript\nnavigation.navigate({ name: SCREEN, key: SCREEN_KEY_A });\nnavigation.navigate({ name: SCREEN, key: SCREEN_KEY_B });\nnavigation.navigate({ name: SCREEN, key: SCREEN_KEY_C });\nnavigation.navigate({ name: SCREEN, key: SCREEN_KEY_D });\n```\n\nNow you are on _screen D_ and want to go back to _screen A_ (popping D, C, and B).\nThen you can use `navigate`:\n\n```js\nnavigation.navigate({ key: SCREEN_KEY_A }); // will go to screen A FROM screen D\n```\n\nAlternatively, as _screen A_ is the top of the stack, you can use `navigation.popToTop()`.\n\n### `reset`\n\nThe `reset` method lets us replace the navigator state with a new state:\n\n<samp id=\"navigate-replace-reset\" />\n\n```js\nnavigation.reset({\n  index: 0,\n  routes: [{ name: 'Profile' }],\n});\n```\n\nThe state object specified in `reset` replaces the existing [navigation state](navigation-state.md) with the new one, i.e. removes existing screens and add new ones. If you want to preserve the existing screens when changing the state, you can use [`CommonActions.reset`](navigation-actions.md#reset) with [`dispatch`](#dispatch) instead.\n\n:::warning\n\nConsider the navigator's state object to be internal and subject to change in a minor release. Avoid using properties from the [navigation state](navigation-state.md) state object except `index` and `routes`, unless you really need it. If there is some functionality you cannot achieve without relying on the structure of the state object, please open an issue.\n\n:::\n\n### `setParams`\n\nThe `setParams` method lets us update the params (`route.params`) of the current screen. `setParams` works like React's `setState` - it shallow merges the provided params object with the current params.\n\n<samp id=\"navigate-set-params\" />\n\n```js\nfunction ProfileScreen({ navigation: { setParams } }) {\n  return (\n    <Button\n      onPress={() =>\n        setParams({\n          friends:\n            route.params.friends[0] === 'Brent'\n              ? ['Wojciech', 'Szymon', 'Jakub']\n              : ['Brent', 'Satya', 'Micha\u015b'],\n          title:\n            route.params.title === \"Brent's Profile\"\n              ? \"Lucy's Profile\"\n              : \"Brent's Profile\",\n        })\n      }\n      title=\"Swap title and friends\"\n    />\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### `setOptions`\n\nThe `setOptions` method lets us set screen options from within the component. This is useful if we need to use the component's props, state or context to configure our screen.\n\n<samp id=\"navigate-set-options\" />\n\n```js\nfunction ProfileScreen({ navigation, route }) {\n  const [value, onChangeText] = React.useState(route.params.title);\n\n  React.useEffect(() => {\n    navigation.setOptions({\n      title: value === '' ? 'No title' : value,\n    });\n  }, [navigation, value]);\n\n  return (\n    <View style={{ flex: 1, alignItems: 'center', justifyContent: 'center' }}>\n      <TextInput\n        style={{ height: 40, borderColor: 'gray', borderWidth: 1 }}\n        onChangeText={onChangeText}\n        value={value}\n      />\n      <Button title=\"Go back\" onPress={() => navigation.goBack()} />\n    </View>\n  );\n}\n```\n\nAny options specified here are shallow merged with the options specified when defining the screen.\n\nWhen using `navigation.setOptions`, we recommend specifying a placeholder in the screen's `options` prop and update it using `navigation.setOptions`. This makes sure that the delay for updating the options isn't noticeable to the user. It also makes it work with lazy-loaded screens.\n\nYou can also use `React.useLayoutEffect` to reduce the delay in updating the options. But we recommend against doing it if you support web and do server side rendering.\n\n:::note\n\n`navigation.setOptions` is intended to provide the ability to update existing options when necessary. It's not a replacement for the `options` prop on the screen. Make sure to use `navigation.setOptions` sparingly only when absolutely necessary.\n\n:::\n\n## Navigation events\n\nScreens can add listeners on the `navigation` prop with the `addListener` method. For example, to listen to the `focus` event:\n\n<samp id=\"simple-focus-and-blur\" />\n\n```js\nfunction Profile({ navigation }) {\n  React.useEffect(() => {\n    const unsubscribe = navigation.addListener('focus', () => {\n      // do something\n    });\n\n    return unsubscribe;\n  }, [navigation]);\n\n  return <ProfileContent />;\n}\n```\n\nSee [Navigation events](navigation-events.md) for more details on the available events and the API usage.\n\n### `isFocused`\n\nThis method lets us check whether the screen is currently focused. Returns `true` if the screen is focused and `false` otherwise.\n\n```js\nconst isFocused = navigation.isFocused();\n```\n\nThis method doesn't re-render the screen when the value changes and mainly useful in callbacks. You probably want to use [useIsFocused](use-is-focused.md) instead of using this directly, it will return a boolean a prop to indicating if the screen is focused.\n\n## Advanced API Reference\n\nThe `dispatch` function is much less commonly used, but a good escape hatch if you can't do what you need with the available methods such as `navigate`, `goBack` etc. We recommend to avoid using the `dispatch` method often unless absolutely necessary.\n\n### `dispatch`\n\nThe `dispatch` method lets us send a navigation action object which determines how the [navigation state](navigation-state.md) will be updated. All of the navigation functions like `navigate` use `dispatch` behind the scenes.\n\nNote that if you want to dispatch actions you should use the action creators provided in this library instead of writing the action object directly.\n\nSee [Navigation Actions Docs](navigation-actions.md) for a full list of available actions.\n\n```js\nimport { CommonActions } from '@react-navigation/native';\n\nnavigation.dispatch(\n  CommonActions.navigate({\n    name: 'Profile',\n    params: {},\n  })\n);\n```\n\nWhen dispatching action objects, you can also specify few additional properties:\n\n- `source` - The key of the route which should be considered as the source of the action. For example, the `replace` action will replace the route with the given key. By default, it'll use the key of the route that dispatched the action. You can explicitly pass `undefined` to override this behavior.\n- `target` - The key of the [navigation state](navigation-state.md) the action should be applied on. By default, actions bubble to other navigators if not handled by a navigator. If `target` is specified, the action won't bubble if the navigator with the same key didn't handle it.\n\nExample:\n\n```js\nimport { CommonActions } from '@react-navigation/native';\n\nnavigation.dispatch({\n  ...CommonActions.navigate('Profile'),\n  source: 'someRoutekey',\n  target: 'someStatekey',\n});\n```\n\n#### Custom action creators\n\nIt's also possible to pass a action creator function to `dispatch`. The function will receive the current state and needs to return a navigation action object to use:\n\n```js\nimport { CommonActions } from '@react-navigation/native';\n\nnavigation.dispatch((state) => {\n  // Add the home route to the start of the stack\n  const routes = [{ name: 'Home' }, ...state.routes];\n\n  return CommonActions.reset({\n    ...state,\n    routes,\n    index: routes.length - 1,\n  });\n});\n```\n\nYou can use this functionality to build your own helpers that you can utilize in your app. Here is an example which implements inserting a screen just before the last one:\n\n```js\nimport { CommonActions } from '@react-navigation/native';\n\nconst insertBeforeLast = (routeName, params) => (state) => {\n  const routes = [\n    ...state.routes.slice(0, -1),\n    { name: routeName, params },\n    state.routes[state.routes.length - 1],\n  ];\n\n  return CommonActions.reset({\n    ...state,\n    routes,\n    index: routes.length - 1,\n  });\n};\n```\n\nThen use it like:\n\n```js\nnavigation.dispatch(insertBeforeLast('Home'));\n```\n\n### `canGoBack`\n\nThis method returns a boolean indicating whether there's any navigation history available in the current navigator, or in any parent navigators. You can use this to check if you can call `navigation.goBack()`:\n\n```js\nif (navigation.canGoBack()) {\n  navigation.goBack();\n}\n```\n\nDon't use this method for rendering content as this will not trigger a re-render. This is only intended for use inside callbacks, event listeners etc.\n\n### `getParent`\n\nThis method returns the navigation prop from the parent navigator that the current navigator is nested in. For example, if you have a stack navigator and a tab navigator nested inside the stack, then you can use `getParent` inside a screen of the tab navigator to get the navigation prop passed from the stack navigator.\n\nIt accepts an optional ID parameter to refer to a specific parent navigator. For example, if your screen is nested with multiple levels of nesting somewhere under a drawer navigator with the `id` prop as `\"LeftDrawer\"`, you can directly refer to it without calling `getParent` multiple times.\n\nTo use an ID for a navigator, first pass a unique `id` prop:\n\n```js\n<Drawer.Navigator id=\"LeftDrawer\">{/* .. */}</Drawer.Navigator>\n```\n\nThen when using `getParent`, instead of:\n\n```js\n// Avoid this\nconst drawerNavigation = navigation.getParent().getParent();\n\n// ...\n\ndrawerNavigation?.openDrawer();\n```\n\nYou can do:\n\n```js\n// Do this\nconst drawerNavigation = navigation.getParent('LeftDrawer');\n\n// ...\n\ndrawerNavigation?.openDrawer();\n```\n\nThis approach allows components to not have to know the nesting structure of the navigators. So it's highly recommended that use an `id` when using `getParent`.\n\nThis method will return `undefined` if there is no matching parent navigator. Be sure to always check for `undefined` when using this method.\n\n### `getState`\n\n:::warning\n\nConsider the navigator's state object to be internal and subject to change in a minor release. Avoid using properties from the [navigation state](navigation-state.md) state object except `index` and `routes`, unless you really need it. If there is some functionality you cannot achieve without relying on the structure of the state object, please open an issue.\n\n:::\n\nThis method returns the state object of the navigator which contains the screen. Getting the navigator state could be useful in very rare situations. You most likely don't need to use this method. If you do, make sure you have a good reason.\n\nIf you need the state for rendering content, you should use [`useNavigationState`](use-navigation-state.md) instead of this method.\n"},r=void 0,c={},d=[{value:"Navigator-dependent functions",id:"navigator-dependent-functions",level:2},{value:"Common API reference",id:"common-api-reference",level:2},{value:"<code>navigate</code>",id:"navigate",level:3},{value:"<code>goBack</code>",id:"goback",level:3},{value:"Going back from a specific screen",id:"going-back-from-a-specific-screen",level:4},{value:"<code>reset</code>",id:"reset",level:3},{value:"<code>setParams</code>",id:"setparams",level:3},{value:"<code>setOptions</code>",id:"setoptions",level:3},{value:"Navigation events",id:"navigation-events",level:2},{value:"<code>isFocused</code>",id:"isfocused",level:3},{value:"Advanced API Reference",id:"advanced-api-reference",level:2},{value:"<code>dispatch</code>",id:"dispatch",level:3},{value:"Custom action creators",id:"custom-action-creators",level:4},{value:"<code>canGoBack</code>",id:"cangoback",level:3},{value:"<code>getParent</code>",id:"getparent",level:3},{value:"<code>getState</code>",id:"getstate",level:3}];function h(e){const n={a:"a",admonition:"admonition",blockquote:"blockquote",code:"code",em:"em",h2:"h2",h3:"h3",h4:"h4",li:"li",p:"p",pre:"pre",ul:"ul",...(0,o.R)(),...e.components};return(0,i.jsxs)(i.Fragment,{children:[(0,i.jsxs)(n.p,{children:["Each ",(0,i.jsx)(n.code,{children:"screen"})," component in your app is provided with the ",(0,i.jsx)(n.code,{children:"navigation"})," prop automatically.
