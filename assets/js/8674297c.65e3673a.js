Here is a basic one, which uses the [router's API](routers.md) to get the active component to render:\n\n```js\nclass MyNavigator extends React.Component {\n  static router = MyRouter;\n  render() {\n    const { state, dispatch, addListener } = this.props.navigation;\n    const { routes, index } = state;\n\n    // Figure out what to render based on the navigation state and the router:\n    const Component = MyRouter.getComponentForState(state);\n\n    // The state of the active child screen can be found at routes[index]\n    let childNavigation = { dispatch, addListener, state: routes[index] };\n    // If we want, we can also tinker with the dispatch function here, to limit\n    // or augment our children's actions\n    // addListener is needed to support children Stack and Drawer navigators\n\n    // Assuming our children want the convenience of calling .navigate() and so on,\n    // we should call addNavigationHelpers to augment our navigation prop:\n    childNavigation = addNavigationHelpers(childNavigation);\n\n    return <Component navigation={childNavigation} />;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Navigation Prop\n\nThe navigation prop passed down to a navigator only includes `state` and `dispatch`. This is the current state of the navigator, and an event channel to send action requests.\n\nAll navigators are controlled components: they always display what is coming in through `props.navigation.state`, and their only way to change the state is to send actions into `props.navigation.dispatch`.\n\nNavigators can specify custom behavior to parent navigators by [customizing their router](custom-routers.md). For example, a navigator is able to specify when actions should be blocked by returning null from `router.getStateForAction`. Or a navigator can specify custom URI handling by overriding `router.getActionForPathAndParams` to output a relevant navigation action, and handling that action in `router.getStateForAction`.\n\n### Navigation State\n\nThe navigation state that is passed into a navigator's `props.navigation.state` has the following structure:\n\n```\n{\n  index: 1, // identifies which route in the routes array is active\n  routes: [\n    {\n      // Each route needs a name, which routers will use to associate each route\n      // with a react component\n      routeName: 'MyRouteName',\n\n      // A unique id for this route, used to keep order in the routes array:\n      key: 'myroute-123',\n\n      // Routes can have any additional data. The included routers have `params`\n      ...customRouteData,\n    },\n    ...moreRoutes,\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Navigation Dispatchers\n\nA navigator can dispatch navigation actions, such as 'Go to a URI', 'Go back'.\n\nThe dispatcher will return `true` if the action was successfully handled, otherwise `false`.\n\n## API for building custom navigators\n\nTo help developers implement custom navigators, the following utilities are provided with React Navigation:\n\n### `createNavigator`\n\nThis utility combines a [router](routers.md) and a [navigation view](navigation-views.md) together in a standard way:\n\n```js\nconst MyApp = createNavigator(MyRouter)(MyView);\n```\n\nAll this does behind the scenes is:\n\n```js\nconst MyApp = ({ navigation }) => (\n  <MyView router={MyRouter} navigation={navigation} />\n);\nMyApp.router = MyRouter;\n```\n\n### `addNavigationHelpers`\n\nTakes in a bare navigator navigation prop with `state` and `dispatch`, and augments it with all the various functions in a screen navigation prop, such as `navigation.navigate()` and `navigation.goBack()`. These functions are simply helpers to create the actions and send them into `dispatch`.\n\n### `createNavigationContainer`\n\nIf you want your navigator to be usable as a top-level component, (without a navigation prop being passed in), you can use `createNavigationContainer`. This utility will make your navigator act like a top-level navigator when the navigation prop is missing. It will manage the app state, and integrate with app-level nav features, like handling incoming and outgoing links, and Android back button behavior.\n"},r=void 0,c={},d=[{value:"Navigation Prop",id:"navigation-prop",level:2},{value:"Navigation State",id:"navigation-state",level:3},{value:"Navigation Dispatchers",id:"navigation-dispatchers",level:3},{value:"API for building custom navigators",id:"api-for-building-custom-navigators",level:2},{value:"<code>createNavigator</code>",id:"createnavigator",level:3},{value:"<code>addNavigationHelpers</code>",id:"addnavigationhelpers",level:3},{value:"<code>createNavigationContainer</code>",id:"createnavigationcontainer",level:3}];function h(n){const t={a:"a",code:"code",h2:"h2",h3:"h3",p:"p",pre:"pre",...(0,o.R)(),...n.components};return(0,i.jsxs)(i.Fragment,{children:[(0,i.jsxs)(t.p,{children:["A navigator is any React component that has a ",(0,i.jsx)(t.a,{href:"https://github.com/react-navigation/react-navigation/blob/1.x/src/routers/StackRouter.js",children:"router"})," on it.
