These issues may or may not be related to React Navigation itself.\n\nBefore troubleshooting an issue, make sure that you have upgraded to **the latest available versions** of the packages. You can install the latest versions by installing the packages again (e.g. `npm install package-name`).\n\n## I\'m getting an error "Unable to resolve module" after updating to the latest version\n\nThis might happen for 3 reasons:\n\n### Stale cache of Metro bundler\n\nIf the module points to a local file (i.e. the name of the module starts with `./`), then it\'s probably due to stale cache. To fix this, try the following solutions.\n\nIf you\'re using Expo, run:\n\n```bash\nexpo start -c\n```\n\nIf you\'re not using Expo, run:\n\n```bash\nnpx react-native start --reset-cache\n```\n\nIf that doesn\'t work, you can also try the following:\n\n```bash\nrm -rf $TMPDIR/metro-bundler-cache-*\n```\n\n### Missing peer dependency\n\nIf the module points to an npm package (i.e. the name of the module doesn\'t with `./`), then it\'s probably due to a missing dependency. To fix this, install the dependency in your project:\n\n```bash npm2yarn\nnpm install name-of-the-module\n```\n\nSometimes it might even be due to a corrupt installation. If clearing cache didn\'t work, try deleting your `node_modules` folder and run `npm install` again.\n\n### Missing extensions in metro configuration\n\nSometimes the error may look like this:\n\n```bash\nError: While trying to resolve module "@react-navigation/native" from file "/path/to/src/App.js", the package "/path/to/node_modules/@react-navigation/native/package.json" was successfully found. However, this package itself specifies a "main" module field that could not be resolved ("/path/to/node_modules/@react-navigation/native/src/index.tsx"\n```\n\nThis can happen if you have a custom configuration for metro and haven\'t specified `ts` and `tsx` as valid extensions. These extensions are present in the default configuration. To check if this is the issue, look for a `metro.config.js` file in your project and check if you have specified the [`sourceExts`](https://facebook.github.io/metro/docs/en/configuration#sourceexts) option. It should at least have the following configuration:\n\n```js\nsourceExts: [\'js\', \'json\', \'ts\', \'tsx\'];\n```\n\nIf it\'s missing these extensions, add them and then clear metro cache as shown in the section above.\n\n## I\'m getting "SyntaxError in @react-navigation/xxx/xxx.tsx" or "SyntaxError: /xxx/@react-navigation/xxx/xxx.tsx: Unexpected token"\n\nThis might happen if you have an old version of the `@react-native/babel-preset` package. Try upgrading it to the latest version.\n\n```bash npm2yarn\nnpm install --save-dev @react-native/babel-preset\n```\n\nIf you have `@babel/core` installed, also upgrade it to latest version.\n\n```bash npm2yarn\nnpm install --save-dev @babel/core\n```\n\nIf upgrading the packages don\'t help, you can also try deleting your `node_modules` and then the lock the file and reinstall your dependencies.\n\nIf you use `npm`:\n\n```bash\nrm -rf node_modules\nrm package-lock.json\nnpm install\n```\n\nIf you use `yarn`:\n\n```bash\nrm -rf node_modules\nrm yarn.lock\nyarn\n```\n\n:::warning\n\nDeleting the lockfile is generally not recommended as it may upgrade your dependencies to versions that haven\'t been tested with your project. So only use this as a last resort.\n\n:::\n\nAfter upgrading or reinstalling the packages, you should also clear Metro bundler\'s cache following the instructions earlier in the page.\n\n## I\'m getting "Module \'[...]\' has no exported member \'xxx\' when using TypeScript\n\nThis might happen if you have an old version of TypeScript in your project. You can try upgrading it:\n\n```bash npm2yarn\nnpm install --save-dev typescript\n```\n\n## I\'m getting an error "null is not an object (evaluating \'RNGestureHandlerModule.default.Direction\')"\n\nThis and some similar errors might occur if you have a bare React Native project and the library [`react-native-gesture-handler`](https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-gesture-handler) library isn\'t linked.\n\nLinking is automatic from React Native 0.60, so if you have linked the library manually, first unlink it:\n\n```bash\nreact-native unlink react-native-gesture-handler\n```\n\nIf you\'re testing on iOS and use Mac, make sure you have run `pod install` in the `ios/` folder:\n\n```bash\ncd ios\npod install\ncd ..\n```\n\nNow rebuild the app and test on your device or simulator.\n\n## I\'m getting an error "requireNativeComponent: "RNCSafeAreaProvider" was not found in the UIManager"\n\nThis and some similar errors might occur if you have a bare React Native project and the library [`react-native-safe-area-context`](https://github.com/th3rdwave/react-native-safe-area-context) library isn\'t linked.\n\nLinking is automatic from React Native 0.60, so if you have linked the library manually, first unlink it:\n\n```bash\nreact-native unlink react-native-safe-area-context\n```\n\nIf you\'re testing on iOS and use Mac, make sure you have run `pod install` in the `ios/` folder:\n\n```bash\ncd ios\npod install\ncd ..\n```\n\nNow rebuild the app and test on your device or simulator.\n\n## I\'m getting an error "Tried to register two views with the same name RNCSafeAreaProvider"\n\nThis might occur if you have multiple versions of [`react-native-safe-area-context`](https://github.com/th3rdwave/react-native-safe-area-context) installed.\n\nIf you\'re using Expo managed workflow, it\'s likely that you have installed an incompatible version. To install the correct version, run:\n\n```bash\nnpx expo install react-native-safe-area-context\n```\n\nIf it didn\'t fix the error or you\'re not using Expo managed workflow, you\'ll need to check which package depends on a different version of `react-native-safe-area-context`.\n\nIf you use `yarn`, run:\n\n```bash\nyarn why react-native-safe-area-context\n```\n\nIf you use `npm`, run:\n\n```bash\nnpm ls react-native-safe-area-context\n```\n\nThis will tell you if a package you use has a dependency on `react-native-safe-area-context`. If it\'s a third-party package, you should open an issue on the relevant repo\'s issue tracker explaining the problem. Generally for libraries, dependencies containing native code should be defined in `peerDependencies` instead of `dependencies` to avoid such issues.\n\nIf it\'s already in `peerDependencies` and not in `dependencies`, and you use `npm`, it might be because of incompatible version range defined for the package. The author of the library will need to relax the version range in such cases to allow a wider range of versions to be installed.\n\nIf you use `yarn`, you can also temporarily override the version being installed using `resolutions`. Add the following in your `package.json`:\n\n```json\n"resolutions": {\n  "react-native-safe-area-context": "<version you want to use>"\n}\n```\n\nAnd then run:\n\n```bash\nyarn\n```\n\nIf you\'re on iOS and not using Expo managed workflow, also run:\n\n```bash\ncd ios\npod install\ncd ..\n```\n\nNow rebuild the app and test on your device or simulator.\n\n## Nothing is visible on the screen after adding a `View`\n\nIf you wrap the container in a `View`, make sure the `View` stretches to fill the container using `flex: 1`:\n\n<Tabs groupId="config" queryString="config">\n<TabItem value="static" label="Static" default>\n\n```js\nimport * as React from \'react\';\nimport { View } from \'react-native\';\nimport { createStaticNavigation } from \'@react-navigation/native\';\n\n/* ... */\n\nconst Navigation = createStaticNavigation(RootStack);\n\nexport default function App() {\n  return (\n    // highlight-next-line\n    <View style={{ flex: 1 }}>\n      <Navigation />\n    </View>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n</TabItem>\n<TabItem value="dynamic" label="Dynamic">\n\n```js\nimport * as React from \'react\';\nimport { View } from \'react-native\';\nimport { NavigationContainer } from \'@react-navigation/native\';\n\nexport default function App() {\n  return (\n    // highlight-next-line\n    <View style={{ flex: 1 }}>\n      <NavigationContainer>{/* ... */}</NavigationContainer>\n    </View>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n</TabItem>\n</Tabs>\n\n## I get the warning "Non-serializable values were found in the navigation state"\n\nThis can happen if you are passing non-serializable values such as class instances, functions etc. in params. React Navigation warns you in this case because this can break other functionality such [state persistence](state-persistence.md), [deep linking](deep-linking.md), [web support](web-support.md) etc.\n\nExample of some use cases for passing functions in params are the following:\n\n- To pass a callback to use in a header button. This can be achieved using `navigation.setOptions` instead. See the [guide for header buttons](header-buttons.md#header-interaction-with-its-screen-component) for examples.\n- To pass a callback to the next screen which it can call to pass some data back. You can usually achieve it using `popTo` instead. See [passing params to a previous screen](params.md#passing-params-to-a-previous-screen) for examples.\n- To pass complex data to another screen. Instead of passing the data `params`, you can store that complex data somewhere else (like a global store), and pass an id instead. Then the screen can get the data from the global store using the id. See [what should be in params](params.md#what-should-be-in-params).\n- Pass data, callbacks etc. from a parent to child screens. You can either use React Context, or pass a children callback to pass these down instead of using params. See [passing additional props](hello-react-navigation.md#passing-additional-props).\n\nWe don\'t generally recommend passing functions in params. But if you don\'t use state persistence, deep links, or use React Navigation on Web, then you can choose to ignore it. To ignore the warning, you can use `LogBox.ignoreLogs`.\n\nExample:\n\n```js\nimport { LogBox } from \'react-native\';\n\nLogBox.ignoreLogs([\n  \'Non-serializable values were found in the navigation state\',\n]);\n```\n\n## I\'m getting "Invalid hook call. Hooks can only be called inside of the body of a function component"\n\nThis can happen when you pass a React component to an option that accepts a function returning a react element. For example, the [`headerTitle` option in native stack navigator](native-stack-navigator.md#headertitle) expects a function returning a react element:\n\n<Tabs groupId="config" queryString="config">\n<TabItem value="static" label="Static" default>\n\n```js\nconst Stack = createNativeStackNavigator({\n  screens: {\n    Home: {\n      screen: Home,\n      options: {\n        // highlight-next-line\n        headerTitle: (props) => <MyTitle {...props} />,\n      },\n    },\n  },\n});\n```\n\n</TabItem>\n<TabItem value="dynamic" label="Dynamic">\n\n```js\n<Stack.Screen\n  name="Home"\n  component={Home}\n  option={{\n    // highlight-next-line\n    headerTitle: (props) => <MyTitle {...props} />,\n  }}\n/>\n```\n\n</TabItem>\n</Tabs>\n\nIf you directly pass a function here, you\'ll get this error when using hooks:\n\n<Tabs groupId="config" queryString="config">\n<TabItem value="static" label="Static" default>\n\n```js\nconst Stack = createNativeStackNavigator({\n  screens: {\n    Home: {\n      screen: Home,\n      options: {\n        // This is not correct\n        // highlight-next-line\n        headerTitle: MyTitle,\n      },\n    },\n  },\n});\n```\n\n</TabItem>\n<TabItem value="dynamic" label="Dynamic">\n\n```js\n<Stack.Screen\n  name="Home"\n  component={Home}\n  option={{\n    // This is not correct\n    // highlight-next-line\n    headerTitle: MyTitle,\n  }}\n/>\n```\n\n</TabItem>\n</Tabs>\n\nThe same applies to other options like `headerLeft`, `headerRight`, `tabBarIcon` etc. as well as props such as `tabBar`, `drawerContent` etc.\n\n## Screens are unmounting/remounting during navigation\n\nSometimes you might have noticed that your screens unmount/remount, or your local component state or the navigation state resets when you navigate. This might happen if you are creating React components during render.\n\nThe simplest example is something like following:\n\n```js\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    <Stack.Navigator>\n      <Stack.Screen\n        name="Home"\n        component={() => {\n          return <SomeComponent />;\n        }}\n      />\n    </Stack.Navigator>\n  );\n}\n```\n\nThe `component` prop expects a React Component, but in the example, it\'s getting a function returning an React Element. While superficially a component and a function returning a React Element look the exact same, they don\'t behave the same way when used.\n\nHere, every time the component re-renders, a new function will be created and passed to the `component` prop. React will see a new component and unmount the previous component before rendering the new one. This will cause any local state in the old component to be lost. React Navigation will detect and warn for this specific case but there can be other ways you might be creating components during render which it can\'t detect.\n\nAnother easy to identify example of this is when you create a component inside another component:\n\n<Tabs groupId="config" queryString="config">\n<TabItem value="static" label="Static" default>\n\n```js\nfunction App() {\n  const Home = () => {\n    return <SomeComponent />;\n  };\n\n  const RootStack = createNativeStackNavigator({\n    screens: {\n      Home: Home,\n    },\n  });\n\n  const Navigation = createStaticNavigation(RootStack);\n\n  return <Navigation />;\n}\n```\n\n</TabItem>\n<TabItem value="dynamic" label="Dynamic">\n\n```js\nfunction App() {\n  const Home = () => {\n    return <SomeComponent />;\n  };\n\n  return (\n    <Stack.Navigator>\n      <Stack.Screen name="Home" component={Home} />\n    </Stack.Navigator>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n</TabItem>\n</Tabs>\n\nOr when you use a higher order component (such as `connect` from Redux, or `withX` functions that accept a component) inside another component:\n\n```js\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    <Stack.Navigator>\n      <Stack.Screen name="Home" component={withSomeData(Home)} />\n    </Stack.Navigator>\n  );\n}\n```\n\nIf you\'re unsure, it\'s always best to make sure that the components you are using as screens are defined outside of a React component. They could be defined in another file and imported, or defined at the top level scope in the same file:\n\n<Tabs groupId="config" queryString="config">\n<TabItem value="static" label="Static" default>\n\n```js\nconst Home = () => {\n  // ...\n\n  return <SomeComponent />;\n};\n\nconst RootStack = createNativeStackNavigator({\n  screens: {\n    Home: Home,\n  },\n});\n\nconst Navigation = createStaticNavigation(RootStack);\n\nfunction App() {\n  return <Navigation />;\n}\n```\n\n</TabItem>\n<TabItem value="dynamic" label="Dynamic">\n\n```js\nconst Home = () => {\n  // ...\n\n  return <SomeComponent />;\n};\n\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    <Stack.Navigator>\n      <Stack.Screen name="Home" component={Home} />\n    </Stack.Navigator>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n</TabItem>\n</Tabs>\n\nThis is not React Navigation specific, but related to React in general. You should always avoid creating components during render, whether you are using React Navigation or not.\n\n## App is not working properly when connected to Chrome Debugger\n\nWhen the app is connected to Chrome Debugger (or other tools that use Chrome Debugger such as [React Native Debugger](https://github.com/jhen0409/react-native-debugger)) you might encounter various issues related to timing.\n\nThis can result in issues such as button presses taking a long time to register or not working at all, [gestures and animations being slow and buggy](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/2367) etc. There can be other functional issues such as promises not resolving, [timeouts and intervals not working correctly](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/4470) etc. as well.\n\nThe issues are not related to React Navigation, but due to the nature of how the Chrome Debugger works. When connected to Chrome Debugger, your whole app runs on Chrome and communicates with the native app via sockets over the network, which can introduce latency and timing related issues.\n\nSo, unless you are trying to debug something, it\'s better to test the app without being connected to the Chrome Debugger. If you are using iOS, you can alternatively use [Safari to debug your app](https://reactnative.dev/docs/debugging#safari-developer-tools) which debugs the app on the device directly and does not have these issues, though it has other downsides.\n'},l=void 0,d={},h=[{value:"I&#39;m getting an error &quot;Unable to resolve module&quot; after updating to the latest version",id:"im-getting-an-error-unable-to-resolve-module-after-updating-to-the-latest-version",level:2},{value:"Stale cache of Metro bundler",id:"stale-cache-of-metro-bundler",level:3},{value:"Missing peer dependency",id:"missing-peer-dependency",level:3},{value:"Missing extensions in metro configuration",id:"missing-extensions-in-metro-configuration",level:3},{value:"I&#39;m getting &quot;SyntaxError in @react-navigation/xxx/xxx.tsx&quot; or &quot;SyntaxError: /xxx/@react-navigation/xxx/xxx.tsx: Unexpected token&quot;",id:"im-getting-syntaxerror-in-react-navigationxxxxxxtsx-or-syntaxerror-xxxreact-navigationxxxxxxtsx-unexpected-token",level:2},{value:"I&#39;m getting &quot;Module &#39;[...]&#39; has no exported member &#39;xxx&#39; when using TypeScript",id:"im-getting-module--has-no-exported-member-xxx-when-using-typescript",level:2},{value:"I&#39;m getting an error &quot;null is not an object (evaluating &#39;RNGestureHandlerModule.default.Direction&#39;)&quot;",id:"im-getting-an-error-null-is-not-an-object-evaluating-rngesturehandlermoduledefaultdirection",level:2},{value:"I&#39;m getting an error &quot;requireNativeComponent: &quot;RNCSafeAreaProvider&quot; was not found in the UIManager&quot;",id:"im-getting-an-error-requirenativecomponent-rncsafeareaprovider-was-not-found-in-the-uimanager",level:2},{value:"I&#39;m getting an error &quot;Tried to register two views with the same name RNCSafeAreaProvider&quot;",id:"im-getting-an-error-tried-to-register-two-views-with-the-same-name-rncsafeareaprovider",level:2},{value:"Nothing is visible on the screen after adding a <code>View</code>",id:"nothing-is-visible-on-the-screen-after-adding-a-view",level:2},{value:"I get the warning &quot;Non-serializable values were found in the navigation state&quot;",id:"i-get-the-warning-non-serializable-values-were-found-in-the-navigation-state",level:2},{value:"I&#39;m getting &quot;Invalid hook call.
