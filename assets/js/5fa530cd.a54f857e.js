This can be useful to improve the perceived performance of the app by preloading the screens that the user is likely to navigate to next.\n- [**Layout props**](/docs/navigator#layout): Navigators and screens now support `layout` props to augment the navigators with additional UI and behavior.\n- [**Improved Web integration**](/docs/web-support): The built in navigators now have better web-support such rendering anchor tags for more elements. The `Link` and `useLinkProps` APIs have also been revamped to use screen names instead of paths.\n- [**Searchbar support in all navigators with header**](/docs/elements#headersearchbaroptions): All navigators with header now support a searchbar in the header. You can customize the searchbar using the `headerSearchBarOptions` option.\n- [**New `useLogger` devtool to replace flipper plugin**](/docs/devtools#uselogger): The `use logger` hook can show navigation actions and state in the console for debugging.\n- [**Sidebar support in Bottom Tab Navigator**](/docs/bottom-tab-navigator#tabbarposition): The Bottom Tab Navigator now supports showing tabs on the side by specifying `tabBarPosition` option as `'left'` or `'right'`.\n- [**Animation support in Bottom Tab Navigator**](/docs/bottom-tab-navigator#animations): The Bottom Tab Navigator now supports animations when switching between tabs. You can customize the animation using the `animation` option.\n- [**`react-native-drawer-layout` package**](/docs/drawer-layout): The drawer implementation used in `@react-navigation/drawer` is now available as a standalone package called `react-native-drawer-layout`.\n- Many other improvements and bug fixes.\n\nSee our [blog post for the release candidate](/blog/2024-06-27-react-navigation-7.0-rc.md) for a more detailed list of highlights.\n\nTo see the full list of changes, check out the [upgrade guide](/docs/upgrading-from-6.x).\n\n## Upgrading\n\nIn addition to the new features and improvements, React Navigation 7 also includes a number of breaking changes. We've put together a [detailed upgrade guide](/docs/upgrading-from-6.x) to help you migrate your app to the latest version.\n\n## Special thanks\n\nI'd like to extend a big thank you to all the contributors who helped with this release. Your contributions are what make React Navigation great.\n\nI want to give a special shoutout to [Micha\u0142 Osadnik](https://x.com/mosdnk) for working through many of the features and improvements in this release as well as providing much-needed motivation.\n\nMany thanks to [Patrycja Kali\u0144ska](https://x.com/patkalinska) and [Ania Cichocka](https://github.com/AnCichocka) from [Software Mansion](https://swmansion.com/) for helping with the documentation.\n\nI'd also like to thank [Tymoteusz Boba](https://x.com/tboba_), [Maciej Stosio](https://x.com/maciekstosio) and [Kacper Kafara](https://x.com/kafara_kacper) from the [React Native Screens](https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-screens). React Navigation wouldn't be where it is today without React Native Screens.\n\nLast but not least, without dedicated time from [Callstack](https://callstack.com/), it would be impossible to maintain and improve React Navigation.\n\n## Sponsor us\n\nIf React Navigation helps you to deliver value to your customers, it'd mean a lot if you could sponsor us. Sponsorships will help us to move more quickly towards our goal of building the best cross-platform navigation library and continue to provide timely support for bug reports in our GitHub issues.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 [Visit our GitHub Sponsors page](https://github.com/sponsors/react-navigation) \ud83d\udc48\n"},r=void 0,c={authorsImageUrls:[void 0]},h=[{value:"Highlights",id:"highlights",level:2},{value:"Upgrading",id:"upgrading",level:2},{value:"Special thanks",id:"special-thanks",level:2},{value:"Sponsor us",id:"sponsor-us",level:2}];function l(e){const t={a:"a",code:"code",h2:"h2",li:"li",p:"p",strong:"strong",ul:"ul",...(0,i.R)(),...e.components};return(0,o.jsxs)(o.Fragment,{children:[(0,o.jsxs)(t.p,{children:["The documentation is now live at ",(0,o.jsx)(t.a,{href:"/docs/getting-started",children:"reactnavigation.org"}),", and v6 lives ",(0,o.jsx)(t.a,{href:"/docs/6.x/getting-started",children:"here"}),"."]}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.p,{children:"React Navigation 7 aims to improve the developer experience with a new static API as well as bring many new features and improvements."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.h2,{id:"highlights",children:"Highlights"}),"\n",(0,o.jsxs)(t.ul,{children:["\n",(0,o.jsxs)(t.li,{children:[(0,o.jsx)(t.a,{href:"/docs/hello-react-navigation?config=static",children:(0,o.jsx)(t.strong,{children:"Static API"})}),": The new static API is an optional API that simplifies the configuration of navigators and makes it easier to work with TypeScript and deep linking."]}),"\n",(0,o.jsxs)(t.li,{children:[(0,o.jsx)(t.a,{href:"/docs/navigation-object/#preload",children:(0,o.jsx)(t.strong,{children:"Preloading screens"})}),": Many navigators now support preloading screens prior to navigating to them.
