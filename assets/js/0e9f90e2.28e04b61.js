It will have its own navigation state and be unable\n     * To interact with any parent navigator, eg: it would not know the route \"Home\" exists\n     */\n    return (\n      <AuthenticationNavigator />\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nconst AppNavigator = createSwitchNavigator({\n  Auth: AuthenticationScreen, // This screen renders a navigator!\n  Home: HomeScreen,\n});\n```\n\nThe correct way to write this would be the following:\n\n```javascript\nexport default App extends React.Component {\n  render() {\n    return <AppNavigator />;\n  }\n}\n\nconst AuthenticationNavigator = createStackNavigator({\n  SignIn: SignInScreen,\n  ForgotPassword: ForgotPasswordScreen,\n});\n\nconst AppNavigator = createSwitchNavigator({\n  /*\n   * Rather than being rendered by a screen component, the\n   * AuthenticationNavigator is a screen component\n   */\n  Auth: AuthenticationNavigator,\n  Home: HomeScreen,\n});\n```\n\nAlternatively, the following would also work because it exposes the `router` static on `AuthenticationScreen` and threads through the `navigation` prop:\n\n```javascript\nexport default App extends React.Component {\n  render() {\n    /* In the root component we are rendering the app navigator */\n    return <AppNavigator />;\n  }\n}\n\nconst AuthenticationNavigator = createStackNavigator({\n  SignIn: SignInScreen,\n  ForgotPassword: ForgotPasswordScreen,\n});\n\nclass AuthenticationScreen extends React.Component {\n  static router = AuthenticationNavigator.router;\n\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <AuthenticationNavigator navigation={this.props.navigation} />\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nconst AppNavigator = createSwitchNavigator({\n  Auth: AuthenticationScreen, // This screen renders a navigator!\n  Home: HomeScreen,\n});\n```\n\n## Assigning navigationOptions to the wrong component\n\nIn previous version of React Navigation, the library used to dig through your component tree to find `navigationOptions`. This is no longer the case, and only `navigationOptions` on screen components of a particular navigator will apply to that navigator.
