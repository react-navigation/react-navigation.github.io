Let's look at one way we can do this in React Navigation - it's not the only way but it'll do the trick. Similar to [themes](themes.md), we will use `screenProps`. You may also want to use React's context API as demonstrated in the [themes](themes.md) guide in order to make it easier to access the translate function from a variety of components.\n\n## Setting up a localization library\n\nWe'll need to use some kind of library to store our translations and provide a function that gives us access to them, along with handling fallbacks when we don't have a particular language defined. Localization and internationalization (i18n) are often used interchangeably, as in the example below where we get the current `locale` from `expo-localization` and use the `i18n-js` library for managing translations, for no particular reason other than it was available - use whatever you like.\n\n```jsx\nimport * as Localization from 'expo-localization'; // or whatever library you want\nimport i18n from 'i18n-js'; // or whatever library you want\n\nconst en = {\n  foo: 'Foo',\n  bar: 'Bar {{someValue}}',\n};\n\nconst fr = {\n  foo: 'Fou',\n  bar: 'B\xe1r {{someValue}}',\n};\n\ni18n.fallbacks = true;\ni18n.translations = { fr, en };\n\n// This will log 'en' for me, as I'm an English speaker\nconsole.log(Localization.locale);\n```\n\n## Wiring up your localization library to navigation\n\nNext let's store our `locale` in the state of our root app component and then thread it through `screenProps` to make it available throughout React Navigation.\n\n```jsx\nexport default class App extends React.Component {\n  state = {\n    locale: Localization.locale,\n  };\n\n  setLocale = (locale) => {\n    this.setState({ locale });\n  };\n\n  t = (scope, options) => {\n    return i18n.t(scope, { locale: this.state.locale, ...options });\n  };\n\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <AppContainer\n        screenProps={{\n          t: this.t,\n          locale: this.state.locale,\n          setLocale: this.setLocale,\n        }}\n      />\n    );\n  }\n}\n```\n\nNow in our screens we can use these `screenProps` as follows:\n\n```jsx\nclass Screen extends React.Component {\n  static navigationOptions = ({ screenProps: { t } }) => ({\n    title: t('foo'),\n  });\n\n  render() {\n    let { t, locale } = this.props.screenProps;\n\n    return (\n      <View style={styles.container}>\n        <Text style={styles.text}>\n          Current locale: {locale}.{' '}\n          {locale !== 'en' && locale !== 'fr'\n            ? 'Translations will fall back to \"en\" because none available'\n            : null}\n        </Text>\n        <Text>{t('bar', { someValue: Date.now() })}</Text>\n        {locale === 'en' ? (\n          <Button\n            title=\"Switch to French\"\n            onPress={() => this.props.screenProps.setLocale('fr')}\n          />\n        ) : (\n          <Button\n            title=\"Switch to English\"\n            onPress={() => this.props.screenProps.setLocale('en')}\n          />\n        )}\n      </View>\n    );\n  }\n}\n```\n\nYou can run this example in [this Snack](https://snack.expo.io/@react-navigation/localization-example). Again, you may want to go further than just passing this through `screenProps` if you want to make it easier to access the `t` function or the other `screenProps` from any React component (and not just screen components that are rendered by React Navigation).
