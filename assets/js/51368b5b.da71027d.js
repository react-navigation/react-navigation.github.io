It has bugs, is missing many features and the API for web integration may change in minor versions. Please help us test it and open bug reports if you encounter a bug.\n\nReact Navigation's web support currently requires using [React Native for Web](https://github.com/necolas/react-native-web). This approach lets us reuse the same code on both React Native and Web.\n\nCurrently, the following features are available:\n\n- [URL integration in browser](configuring-links.md)\n- [Accessible links](link.md)\n- [Server rendering](server-rendering.md)\n\nIt's important to use links as the primary way of navigation instead of navigation actions such as `navigation.navigate`. It'll ensure that your links are properly usable on web.\n\nSome of the navigators are also configured differently on web or provide additional web specific features:\n\n1. The [drawer](drawer-navigator.md) and [bottom tab](bottom-tab-navigator.md) navigators show hyperlinks in the drawer sidebar and tab bar respectively.\n2. Swipe gestures are not available on [drawer](drawer-navigator.md) and [stack](stack-navigator.md) navigators when using on the web.\n3. By default, [stack](stack-navigator.md) navigator disables page transition animations, but it can be re-enabled by specifying `animationEnabled: true`.\n\n> Note: Unlike React Navigation 4, you don't need to install a separate package to use web integration when using React Native for Web. If you have the `@react-navigation/web` package installed, please uninstall it because it cannot be used with React Navigation 5.\n"},o=void 0,c={},l=[];function d(e){const n={a:"a",blockquote:"blockquote",code:"code",li:"li",ol:"ol",p:"p",ul:"ul",...(0,r.R)(),...e.components};return(0,i.jsxs)(i.Fragment,{children:[(0,i.jsxs)(n.blockquote,{children:["\n",(0,i.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Note: Support for web is experimental and a work in progress.
