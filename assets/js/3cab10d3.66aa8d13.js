There are many more improvements planned for the final release.\n\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\n\nYou can read the full list of changes in the [upgrade guide](/docs/8.x/upgrading-from-7.x). Here are some highlights:\n\n## Highlights\n\n### Native Bottom Tabs by default\n\nThe Bottom Tab Navigator now uses native primitives by default on iOS and Android based on [`react-native-screens`](https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-screens).\n\nThis lets us provide a native look by default, such as the new liquid glass effect on iOS 26.\n\n<video playsInline autoPlay muted loop style={{ width: '500px', aspectRatio: 3 / 1 }}>\n\n  <source src=\"/assets/blog/8.x/native-bottom-tabs-ios.mp4\" />\n</video>\n\n<video playsInline autoPlay muted loop style={{ width: '500px', aspectRatio: 3 / 1 }}>\n\n  <source src=\"/assets/blog/8.x/native-bottom-tabs-android.mp4\" />\n</video>\n\nWe made the native implementation the default because we believe that the default experience should be as close to platform conventions as possible.\n\nHowever, we still include a custom JS-based implementation to avoid breaking existing apps and support other platforms such as Web. You can switch to the JS implementation by passing the [`implementation`](/docs/8.x/bottom-tab-navigator#implementation) prop as `custom` to the navigator.\n\nSee [Bottom Tab Navigator docs](/docs/8.x/bottom-tab-navigator) for more details.\n\n### Access to `route`, `navigation`, and state for any parent screen\n\nOne of the commonly requested features has been for screens to be able to access the params for parent screens, but this had a few problems:\n\n- Passing down params to child screens may lead to unnecessary re-renders when the parent params change, even when they are not needed by the child screen.\n- Since the param types are defined by the screen itself, having additional parent params would not be compatible with the existing type system.\n\nIt was necessary to manually set up React Context to pass down parent params, which was cumbersome.\n\nThe new screen name parameter in `useRoute` solves these problems. Now, you can access the parent route and its params directly by specifying the screen name:\n\n```js\nconst route = useRoute('Profile');\n\n// Params for the 'Profile' screen\nconsole.log(route.params);\n```\n\nSimilarly, you can get the `navigation` object for any parent screen by specifying the screen name in `useNavigation`:\n\n```js\nconst navigation = useNavigation('Profile');\n\n// Navigation object for the 'Profile' screen\nconsole.log(navigation);\n```\n\nAnd you can get the navigation state for any parent screen by specifying the screen name in `useNavigationState`:\n\n```js\nconst focusedRoute = useNavigationState(\n  'Profile',\n  (state) => state.routes[state.index]\n);\n\n// Focused route for the navigator that contains the 'Profile' screen\nconsole.log(focusedRoute);\n```\n\nSee [`useRoute`](/docs/8.x/use-route), [`useNavigation`](/docs/8.x/use-navigation), and [`useNavigationState`](/docs/8.x/use-navigation-state) for more details.\n\n### Better TypeScript types for static configuration\n\nOne of the goals of React Navigation has always been to work well with TypeScript. React Navigation 5 was built from the ground up with TypeScript support, even though it required a lot of boilerplate, the basic blocks were there. In React Navigation 7, we introduced a static API to reduce boilerplate with automatic type inference. However, it still required manual type annotations in some cases and didn't express React Navigation's full capabilities. So we had more work to do to get to a point that we're happy with.\n\nIn this release, we've built upon the static API and reworked the type inference to solve many of these issues.\n\nHooks like `useNavigation`, `useRoute`, and `useNavigationState` now automatically infer types based on the provided screen name:\n\n```js\nconst navigation = useNavigation('Profile');\n\n// navigation is correctly typed as StackNavigationProp<RootStackParamList, 'Profile'>\n```\n\nThe `navigation` object will now have proper types based on navigator nesting, and will include navigator-specific methods such as `openDrawer` for drawer navigators or `push` for stack navigators without requiring manual type annotations.\n\n<video playsInline autoPlay muted loop data-landscape>\n  <source src=\"/assets/blog/8.x/use-navigation.mp4\" />\n</video>\n\nThe `useRoute` hook now returns a union of all route types in the project when no screen name is provided, so it can be used in reusable components while still providing type safety.\n\nIt will return the appropriate route type when a screen name is specified:\n\n```js\nconst route = useRoute('Profile');\n\n// route is correctly typed as RouteProp<RootStackParamList, 'Profile'>\n```\n\n<video playsInline autoPlay muted loop data-landscape>\n  <source src=\"/assets/blog/8.x/use-route.mp4\" />\n</video>\n\nSimilarly, the `useNavigationState` hook will infer the correct state type for the navigator that contains the specified screen:\n\n```js\nconst focusedRoute = useNavigationState(\n  'Profile',\n  (state) => state.routes[state.index]\n);\n\n// state is correctly typed as StackNavigationState<RootStackParamList>\n```\n\nIn addition, previously, the type of the `route` object couldn't be inferred in screen callbacks, listener callbacks, etc. This made it difficult to use route params in these callbacks.\n\nThe new `createXScreen` helper functions address this:\n\n```js\nconst Stack = createStackNavigator({\n  screens: {\n    // highlight-next-line\n    Profile: createStackScreen({\n      screen: ProfileScreen,\n      options: ({ route }) => {\n        const userId = route.params.userId;\n\n        return {\n          title: `${userId}'s profile`\n        };\n      },\n    });\n  }\n});\n```\n\nHere, the type of `route.params` is correctly inferred based on the type annotation of `ProfileScreen`.\n\nNot only that, but it also infers types based on the path pattern in the `linking` configuration specified for the screen:\n\n```js\nconst Stack = createStackNavigator({\n  screens: {\n    Profile: createStackScreen({\n      screen: ProfileScreen,\n      // highlight-start\n      linking: {\n        path: 'profile/:userId',\n        parse: {\n          userId: (userId) => Number(userId),\n        },\n      },\n      // highlight-end\n    });\n  }\n});\n```\n\nIn this case, React Navigation can automatically infer that `userId` is a param of type `number` based on `:userId` in the path pattern and the return type of `userId` in the `parse` config. This is inspired by how [TanStack Router infers types based on the URL pattern](https://tanstack.com/router/latest/docs/framework/solid/decisions-on-dx#declaring-the-router-instance-for-type-inference).\n\n<video playsInline autoPlay muted loop data-landscape>\n  <source src=\"/assets/blog/8.x/params-types.mp4\" />\n</video>\n\nEach navigator exports its own helper function, e.g. `createNativeStackScreen` for Native Stack Navigator, `createBottomTabScreen` for Bottom Tab Navigator, `createDrawerScreen` for Drawer Navigator etc.\n\nWith all of these improvements, it's technically possible to write an app without any manual type annotations for React Navigation, since we can infer the route type from path pattern and param parsing logic, and return the correct type for `navigation` object, `route` object, and navigation state based on the screen name and navigation structure automatically.\n\nSee [TypeScript docs](/docs/8.x/typescript) and [Static configuration docs](/docs/8.x/static-configuration) for more details.\n\n### Push history entries without pushing new screens\n\nTraditionally, the only way to add a new entry to the history stack was by pushing a new screen. But it's not always desirable, as it adds an entirely new instance of the screen component and shows transition animations.\n\nFor many scenarios, we may want to add a new history entry without pushing a new screen. Such as:\n\n- A product listing page with filters, where changing filters should create a new history entry so that users can go back to previous filter states.\n- A screen with a custom modal component, where the modal is not a separate screen in the navigator, but its state should be reflected in the URL and history.\n\nThe new `pushParams` API makes this possible. You can now push an entry to the history stack by adding new params without needing to push a new screen. Then the back button will update the screen to the previous params instead of going back a screen.\n\n<video playsInline autoPlay muted loop data-landscape style={{ '--ifm-global-radius': '10px' }}>\n\n  <source src=\"/assets/blog/8.x/push-params.mp4\" />\n</video>\n\nThis is especially important on the Web, where users expect that changing certain UI states should create a new history entry, so that they can use the browser back and forward buttons to navigate through these states.\n\nSee [`pushParams` docs](/docs/8.x/navigation-object#pushparams) for more details.\n\n### `PlatformColor`, `DynamicColorIOS` and CSS custom properties in theme\n\nPreviously, React Navigation's theming system only supported string color values. In this release, we've added support for platform-specific dynamic colors such as `PlatformColor` and `DynamicColorIOS` on native, as well as CSS custom properties on the Web.\n\nThis makes it easier to use system colors as well as share colors across native components and React Navigation components.\n\n```js\nconst MyTheme = {\n  ...DefaultTheme,\n  colors: Platform.select({\n    ios: () => ({\n      primary: PlatformColor('systemRed'),\n      background: PlatformColor('systemGroupedBackground'),\n      // ...\n    }),\n    android: () => ({\n      primary: PlatformColor('@android:color/system_primary_light'),\n      // ...\n    }),\n    default: () => DefaultTheme.colors,\n  })(),\n};\n```\n\nHowever, there's one limitation: with string colors, React Navigation can automatically adjust colors in some scenarios (e.g. adjust the text color based on background color), which is not possible with dynamic colors. So it will fallback to pre-defined colors according to the theme in these cases.\n\nSee [Themes docs](/docs/8.x/themes) for more details.\n\n### Deep link to screens behind conditional rendering\n\nConditionally defining screens is a common pattern for [handling authentication flows](/docs/8.x/auth-flow). But if a user opened a deep link to a screen that's behind a condition like auth, previously it would just get ignored.\n\nIt wasn't ideal, and [working around this limitation](https://www.callstack.com/blog/deep-links-with-authentication-in-react-navigation) was not straightforward either. We tried to solve this in React Navigation 7, but the approach we had in mind was problematic, so we decided to revisit it later.\n\nNow we have a better approach in React Navigation 8 which is also straightforward to use:\n\n<Tabs groupId=\"config\" queryString=\"config\">\n<TabItem value=\"static\" label=\"Static\" default>\n\n```js\nconst MyStack = createStackNavigator({\n  // highlight-next-line\n  routeNamesChangeBehavior: 'lastUnhandled',\n  screens: {\n    // ...\n  },\n});\n```\n\n</TabItem>\n<TabItem value=\"dynamic\" label=\"Dynamic\">\n\n```js\nfunction MyStack() {\n  return (\n    <Stack.Navigator\n      // highlight-next-line\n      routeNamesChangeBehavior=\"lastUnhandled\"\n    >\n      {/* ... */}\n    </Stack.Navigator>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n</TabItem>\n</Tabs>\n\n<video playsInline autoPlay muted loop style={{ width: '500px', aspectRatio: 1 / 1 }}>\n\n  <source src=\"/assets/blog/8.x/deep-link-auth.mp4\" />\n</video>\n\nThe navigator will remember the last unhandled action (such as an unhandled deep link) if `routeNamesChangeBehavior: 'lastUnhandled'` is specified. When the list of route names changes (e.g. new screens become available), it will try to handle the action again. See [`routeNamesChangeBehavior` docs](/docs/8.x/navigator#route-names-change-behavior) for more details.\n\nWe also backported this feature to React Navigation 7 with an `UNSTABLE_` prefix as [`UNSTABLE_routeNamesChangeBehavior`](/docs/auth-flow#handling-deep-links-after-auth), so you can try it out in your existing apps without needing to upgrade.\n\n### Persistor for state persistence\n\nOne of the very nice features is persisting navigation state across app restarts. It can be used to improve UX by making sure the user doesn't lose their place in the app.\n\nWhat I really like is to use it during development. Fast Refresh is great, but full reload's can't always be avoided. Being put back to where I was before is really nice to continue working - even more so if my work involved multiple screens in a flow.\n\nWhile it was possible to implement this using `onStateChange` and `initialState`, it required some boilerplate code and handling additional cases, e.g. don't restore state if there is a deep link.\n\nTo make this simpler, we've added a `persistor` prop which takes care of these details:\n\n<Tabs groupId=\"config\" queryString=\"config\">\n<TabItem value=\"static\" label=\"Static\" default>\n\n```js\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    <Navigation\n      // highlight-start\n      persistor={{\n        async persist(state) {\n          await AsyncStorage.setItem(\n            'NAVIGATION_STATE_V1',\n            JSON.stringify(state)\n          );\n        },\n        async restore() {\n          const state = await AsyncStorage.getItem('NAVIGATION_STATE_V1');\n\n          return state ? JSON.parse(state) : undefined;\n        },\n      }}\n      // highlight-end\n    />\n  );\n}\n```\n\n</TabItem>\n<TabItem value=\"dynamic\" label=\"Dynamic\">\n\n```js\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    <NavigationContainer\n      // highlight-start\n      persistor={{\n        async persist(state) {\n          await AsyncStorage.setItem(\n            'NAVIGATION_STATE_V1',\n            JSON.stringify(state)\n          );\n        },\n        async restore() {\n          const state = await AsyncStorage.getItem('NAVIGATION_STATE_V1');\n\n          return state ? JSON.parse(state) : undefined;\n        },\n      }}\n      // highlight-end\n    >\n      {/* ... */}\n    </NavigationContainer>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n</TabItem>\n</Tabs>\n\nSee [State persistence docs](/docs/8.x/state-persistence) for more details.\n\n## Plans for the final release\n\nThis is just the first alpha release of React Navigation 8.0. Some of the plans for the final release include:\n\n- API to handle insets for navigation elements such as headers and tab bars\n- Show Navigation events in React Navigation Devtools\n- Improve accessibility on Web by utilizing [`inert`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/inert)\n- Integrate [`Activity`](https://react.dev/reference/react/Activity) for inactive screens\n\n## Try it out\n\nIf you'd like to try it out, add `@next` to the package you're installing. For example:\n\n```sh npm2yarn\nnpm install @react-navigation/native@next @react-navigation/bottom-tabs@next\n```\n\nYour feedback is very important to us to ensure a smooth final release.
