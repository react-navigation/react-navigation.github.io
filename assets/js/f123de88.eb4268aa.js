Let's take a look at a summary of its use cases:\n\n### Usage with the [`navigate`](navigation-actions.md#navigate) call\n\nIf no key is provided, `StackRouter` will behave as follows:\n\n- if a route with the given name already exists in the state, `StackRouter` will jump to the existing route, along with setting the new parameters.\n- if no such route exists, `StackRouter` will push it onto the stack\n\nIf, however, you want to push several instances of the same route, you can do so by providing a unique `key` parameter each time you call `navigate`, or you can use the `push` action available on `StackRouter`. See the related [RFC](https://github.com/react-navigation/rfcs/blob/master/text/0004-less-pushy-navigate.md) for more background.\n\n> Note: the behavior of `navigate` without a `key` is significantly different in the 1.x series of releases. Read more about it [here](https://gist.github.com/vonovak/ef72f5efe1d36742de8968ff6a708985).\n\n### Usage with [`reset`](stack-actions.md#reset)\n\nWhen resetting, `key` is also optional and can be a string or `null`. If set, the navigator with the given key will reset. If `null`, the root navigator will reset. You can obtain a route's navigator key by calling `this.props.navigation.dangerouslyGetParent().state.key`. Reason why the function is called `dangerouslyGetParent` is to warn developers against overusing it to eg. get parent of parent and other hard-to-follow patterns.\n\n### Usage with [`replace`](stack-actions.md#replace)\n\nWith the `replace` navigation action, `key` is a required parameter used for identifying the route to be replaced. If you use the helper function `this.props.navigation.replace`, we will automatically substitute the key of the current route.\n\n### Usage with `goBack`\n\nPlease refer to the [`goBack docs`](navigation-prop.md#goback---close-the-active-screen-and-move-back) for a detailed explanation.\n"},r=void 0,c={},l=[{value:"Usage with the <code>navigate</code> call",id:"usage-with-the-navigate-call",level:3},{value:"Usage with <code>reset</code>",id:"usage-with-reset",level:3},{value:"Usage with <code>replace</code>",id:"usage-with-replace",level:3},{value:"Usage with <code>goBack</code>",id:"usage-with-goback",level:3}];function h(e){const t={a:"a",blockquote:"blockquote",code:"code",h3:"h3",li:"li",p:"p",ul:"ul",...(0,o.R)(),...e.components};return(0,i.jsxs)(i.Fragment,{children:[(0,i.jsxs)(t.p,{children:["The ",(0,i.jsx)(t.code,{children:"key"})," parameter comes up repeatedly across different navigation functions.
