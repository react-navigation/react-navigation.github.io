These changes will be run through our [new RFC process](https://github.com/react-navigation/rfcs). For example, the [Navigator View API RFC](https://github.com/react-navigation/rfcs/blob/master/text/0002-navigator-view-api.md) outlines a plan to decouple views from the router in order to make it easier for other navigation APIs, such as [react-native-router-flux](https://github.com/aksonov/react-native-router-flux) and [react-router-native](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router/tree/master/packages/react-router-native), to build on top of the same navigation views. We\u2019re also very excited about a plan (no RFC is open yet, but keep an eye out for it) to use [react-native-gesture-handler](https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-gesture-handler) to run navigation gestures (sliding a drawer open, or swiping back on a stack, for example) on the UI thread using the Animated native driver.\n\nLast week we released an updated version of our [documentation website](/docs/1.x/getting-started), built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/). We hope that the new documentation will help newcomers get onboarded with the fundamentals of React Navigation, and serve as an ongoing resource to handle specific use cases as you come across them (under the \u201cHow do I do..?\u201d section). [Contributions to the documentation are very welcome](https://github.com/react-navigation/react-navigation.github.io).\n\n[Give React Navigation 1.0 a try](/docs/1.x/getting-started), [post a feature request](https://react-navigation.canny.io/feature-requests) if you think something is missing, [open a RFC](https://github.com/react-navigation/rfcs) if you have an idea of how to implement it, [file a detailed bug report](https://github.com/react-navigation/react-navigation/issues) when you encounter problems (or [open a pull request](https://github.com/react-navigation/react-navigation/pulls) if you know how to fix them)!
