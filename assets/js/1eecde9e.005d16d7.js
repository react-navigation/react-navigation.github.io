This feature is known as a [Shared Element Transition](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated/docs/shared-element-transitions/overview/) and it's implemented in the [`@react-navigation/native-stack`](native-stack-navigator.md) with [React Native Reanimated](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated/).\n\n:::warning\n\nShared Element Transitions are an experimental feature not recommended for production use yet.\n\n**Architecture support:**\n\n- **Reanimated 3** supports Shared Element Transitions on the **Old Architecture** (Paper).\n- **Reanimated 4** supports them on the **New Architecture** (Fabric) since **4.2.0**, but the feature is behind a feature flag. You need to [enable the `ENABLE_SHARED_ELEMENT_TRANSITIONS` feature flag](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated/docs/guides/feature-flags#enable_shared_element_transitions) to use it.\n\nCheck [the Reanimated documentation](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated/docs/shared-element-transitions/overview/) for details and [send feedback to the Reanimated team](https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-reanimated)\n\n:::\n\n<video playsInline autoPlay muted loop>\n  <source src=\"/assets/shared-element-transitions/shared-element-transitions.mp4\" />\n</video>\n\n## Pre-requisites\n\nBefore continuing this guide make sure your app meets these criteria:\n\n- You are using [`@react-navigation/native-stack`](native-stack-navigator.md). JS-based [`@react-navigation/stack`](stack-navigator.md) or other navigators are not supported.\n- You have [`react-native-reanimated`](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated/docs/fundamentals/getting-started) **v3.0.0 or higher** installed and configured.\n- If you are using **Reanimated 4** (New Architecture), you must [enable the `ENABLE_SHARED_ELEMENT_TRANSITIONS` feature flag](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated/docs/guides/feature-flags#enable_shared_element_transitions).\n\n## Minimal example\n\nTo create a shared transition:\n\n1. Use `Animated` components imported from `react-native-reanimated`.\n2. Assign the same `sharedTransitionTag` to elements on different screens.\n3. Navigate between screens. The transition will start automatically.\n\n```jsx\nimport * as React from 'react';\nimport { View, Button, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';\nimport { NavigationContainer } from '@react-navigation/native';\nimport { createNativeStackNavigator } from '@react-navigation/native-stack';\n\nimport Animated from 'react-native-reanimated';\n\n// highlight-next-line\nconst Stack = createNativeStackNavigator();\n\nfunction HomeScreen({ navigation }) {\n  return (\n    <View style={styles.container}>\n      <Button\n        title=\"Go to Details\"\n        onPress={() => navigation.navigate('Details')}\n      />\n      <Animated.Image\n        source={{ uri: 'https://picsum.photos/id/39/200' }}\n        style={{ width: 300, height: 300 }}\n        // highlight-next-line\n        sharedTransitionTag=\"tag\"\n      />\n    </View>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction DetailsScreen({ navigation }) {\n  return (\n    <View style={styles.container}>\n      <Button title=\"Go back\" onPress={() => navigation.goBack()} />\n      <Animated.Image\n        source={{ uri: 'https://picsum.photos/id/39/200' }}\n        style={{ width: 100, height: 100 }}\n        // highlight-next-line\n        sharedTransitionTag=\"tag\"\n      />\n    </View>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default function App() {\n  return (\n    <NavigationContainer>\n      <Stack.Navigator>\n        <Stack.Screen name=\"Home\" component={HomeScreen} />\n        <Stack.Screen name=\"Details\" component={DetailsScreen} />\n      </Stack.Navigator>\n    </NavigationContainer>\n  );\n}\n\nconst styles = StyleSheet.create({\n  container: {\n    flex: 1,\n    alignItems: 'center',\n  },\n});\n```\n\n`sharedTransitionTag` is a string that has to be unique in the context of a single screen, but has to match elements between screens. This prop allows Reanimated to identify and animate the elements, similarly to the [`key`](https://react.dev/learn/rendering-lists#keeping-list-items-in-order-with-key) property, which tells React which element in the list is which.\n\n## Customizing the transition\n\nYou can customize the transition by passing a custom `SharedTransition` configuration via the `sharedTransitionStyle` prop. Apply the same `sharedTransitionStyle` to the matching element on the target screen.\n\nCustom transition configuration is not fully finalized and might change in a future release.\n\n### Old Architecture (Reanimated 3)\n\nBy default, the transition animates `width`, `height`, `originX`, `originY`, and `transform` using `withTiming` with a 500 ms duration. You can customize the transition using `SharedTransition.custom()`:\n\n```jsx\nimport { SharedTransition, withSpring } from 'react-native-reanimated';\n\n// highlight-start\nconst customTransition = SharedTransition.custom((values) => {\n  'worklet';\n\n  return {\n    height: withSpring(values.targetHeight),\n    width: withSpring(values.targetWidth),\n    originX: withSpring(values.targetOriginX),\n    originY: withSpring(values.targetOriginY),\n  };\n});\n// highlight-end\n\nfunction HomeScreen() {\n  return (\n    <Animated.Image\n      style={{ width: 300, height: 300 }}\n      sharedTransitionTag=\"tag\"\n      // highlight-next-line\n      sharedTransitionStyle={customTransition} // add this to both elements on both screens\n    />\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### New Architecture (Reanimated 4)\n\nOn the New Architecture, the default transition animates `width`, `height`, `originX`, `originY`, `transform`, `backgroundColor`, and `opacity` using `withTiming` with a 500 ms duration.\n\nCurrently customization is more limited due to ongoing development. You can't define fully custom animation functions. Instead, use the `SharedTransition` builder class to configure duration and spring-based animations:\n\n```jsx\nimport { SharedTransition } from 'react-native-reanimated';\n\n// Customize duration and use spring animation\n// highlight-next-line\nconst customTransition = SharedTransition.duration(550).springify();\n\nfunction HomeScreen() {\n  return (\n    <Animated.Image\n      style={{ width: 300, height: 300 }}\n      sharedTransitionTag=\"tag\"\n      // highlight-next-line\n      sharedTransitionStyle={customTransition}\n    />\n  );\n}\n```\n\n## Reference\n\nYou can find a full Shared Element Transitions reference in the [React Native Reanimated documentation](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated/docs/shared-element-transitions/overview/).\n\n## Limitations\n\nShared Element Transitions currently have several limitations to be aware of:\n\n- Only the [native stack navigator](native-stack-navigator.md) is supported\n- Other navigators such as JS stack, drawer, and bottom tabs are not supported\n- Transitions with native modals don't work properly on iOS\n\n### New Architecture specific limitations (Reanimated 4)\n\nThe following limitations apply specifically when using Reanimated 4 on the New Architecture:\n\n- The feature must be enabled via the `ENABLE_SHARED_ELEMENT_TRANSITIONS` feature flag\n- Custom animation functions are not supported; you can only customize duration and use spring-based animations\n- Some properties (e.g., `backgroundColor`) are not supported in progress-based transitions (iOS back gesture)\n- There are performance bottlenecks with transforms being recalculated too eagerly\n- On iOS, you may encounter issues with vertical positioning due to header height information propagation\n\nThe limitations will be addressed in future Reanimated releases.\n\n## Alternatives\n\nAlternatively, you can use [`react-native-shared-element`](https://github.com/IjzerenHein/react-native-shared-element) library with a [React Navigation binding](https://github.com/IjzerenHein/react-navigation-shared-element) which implements Shared Element Transitions in a JS-based `@react-navigation/stack` navigator. This solution, however, isn't actively maintained.\n\nThe [`react-native-navigation`](https://github.com/wix/react-native-navigation) also comes with support for Shared Element Transitions. You can read more about it [here](https://wix.github.io/react-native-navigation/docs/style-animations#shared-element-transitions).\n"},o="Animating elements between screens",c={},h=[{value:"Pre-requisites",id:"pre-requisites",level:2},{value:"Minimal example",id:"minimal-example",level:2},{value:"Customizing the transition",id:"customizing-the-transition",level:2},{value:"Old Architecture (Reanimated 3)",id:"old-architecture-reanimated-3",level:3},{value:"New Architecture (Reanimated 4)",id:"new-architecture-reanimated-4",level:3},{value:"Reference",id:"reference",level:2},{value:"Limitations",id:"limitations",level:2},{value:"New Architecture specific limitations (Reanimated 4)",id:"new-architecture-specific-limitations-reanimated-4",level:3},{value:"Alternatives",id:"alternatives",level:2}];function d(e){const n={a:"a",admonition:"admonition",code:"code",h1:"h1",h2:"h2",h3:"h3",header:"header",li:"li",ol:"ol",p:"p",pre:"pre",strong:"strong",ul:"ul",...(0,r.R)(),...e.components};return(0,a.jsxs)(a.Fragment,{children:[(0,a.jsx)(n.header,{children:(0,a.jsx)(n.h1,{id:"animating-elements-between-screens",children:"Animating elements between screens"})}),"\n",(0,a.jsxs)(n.p,{children:["This guide covers how to animate elements between screens.
