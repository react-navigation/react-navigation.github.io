If you want to use the drawer without React Navigation integration, use the library directly instead.\n\n## Installation\n\nTo use this navigator, ensure that you have [`@react-navigation/native` and its dependencies (follow this guide)](getting-started.md), then install [`@react-navigation/drawer`](https://github.com/react-navigation/react-navigation/tree/main/packages/drawer):\n\n```bash npm2yarn\nnpm install @react-navigation/drawer@^6.x\n```\n\nThen, you need to install and configure the libraries that are required by the drawer navigator:\n\n1. First, install [`react-native-gesture-handler`](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-gesture-handler/) and [`react-native-reanimated`](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated/).\n\n   If you have a Expo managed project, in your project directory, run:\n\n   ```bash\n   npx expo install react-native-gesture-handler react-native-reanimated\n   ```\n\n   If you have a bare React Native project, in your project directory, run:\n\n   ```bash npm2yarn\n   npm install react-native-gesture-handler react-native-reanimated@^2\n   ```\n\n   The Drawer supports both Reanimated 1 and the latest version of Reanimated. If you want to use the latest version of Reanimated, make sure to configure it following the [installation guide](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated/docs/fundamentals/getting-started).\n\n2. To finalize the installation of `react-native-gesture-handler`, we need to conditionally import it. To do this, create 2 files:\n\n   ```js title=\"gesture-handler.native.js\"\n   // Only import react-native-gesture-handler on native platforms\n   import 'react-native-gesture-handler';\n   ```\n\n   ```js title=\"gesture-handler.js\"\n   // Don't import react-native-gesture-handler on web\n   ```\n\n   Now, add the following at the **top** (make sure it's at the top and there's nothing else before it) of your entry file, such as `index.js` or `App.js`:\n\n   ```js\n   import './gesture-handler';\n   ```\n\n   Since the drawer navigator doesn't use `react-native-gesture-handler` on Web, this avoids unnecessarily increasing the bundle size.\n\n   :::warning\n\n   If you are building for Android or iOS, do not skip this step, or your app may crash in production even if it works fine in development. This is not applicable to other platforms.\n\n   :::\n\n3. If you're on a Mac and developing for iOS, you also need to install the pods (via [Cocoapods](https://cocoapods.org/)) to complete the linking.\n\n   ```bash\n   npx pod-install ios\n   ```\n\n## API Definition\n\nTo use this drawer navigator, import it from `@react-navigation/drawer`:\n\n<samp id=\"simple-drawer\" />\n\n```js\nimport { createDrawerNavigator } from '@react-navigation/drawer';\n\nconst Drawer = createDrawerNavigator();\n\nfunction MyDrawer() {\n  return (\n    <Drawer.Navigator>\n      <Drawer.Screen name=\"Feed\" component={Feed} />\n      <Drawer.Screen name=\"Article\" component={Article} />\n    </Drawer.Navigator>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n:::note\n\nFor a complete usage guide please visit [Drawer Navigation](drawer-based-navigation.md).\n\n:::\n\n### Props\n\nThe `Drawer.Navigator` component accepts following props:\n\n#### `id`\n\nOptional unique ID for the navigator. This can be used with [`navigation.getParent`](navigation-prop.md#getparent) to refer to this navigator in a child navigator.\n\n#### `initialRouteName`\n\nThe name of the route to render on the first load of the navigator.\n\n#### `screenOptions`\n\nDefault options to use for the screens in the navigator.\n\n#### `backBehavior`\n\nThis controls what happens when `goBack` is called in the navigator. This includes pressing the device's back button or back gesture on Android.\n\nIt supports the following values:\n\n- `firstRoute` - return to the first screen defined in the navigator (default)\n- `initialRoute` - return to initial screen passed in `initialRouteName` prop, if not passed, defaults to the first screen\n- `order` - return to screen defined before the focused screen\n- `history` - return to last visited screen in the navigator; if the same screen is visited multiple times, the older entries are dropped from the history\n- `none` - do not handle back button\n\n#### `defaultStatus`\n\nThe default status of the drawer - whether the drawer should stay `open` or `closed` by default.\n\nWhen this is set to `open`, the drawer will be open from the initial render. It can be closed normally using gestures or programmatically. However, when going back, the drawer will re-open if it was closed. This is essentially the opposite of the default behavior of the drawer where it starts `closed`, and the back button closes an open drawer.\n\n#### `detachInactiveScreens`\n\nBoolean used to indicate whether inactive screens should be detached from the view hierarchy to save memory. This enables integration with [react-native-screens](https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-screens). Defaults to `true`.\n\n#### `useLegacyImplementation`\n\nWhether to use the legacy implementation based on Reanimated 1. The new implementation based on Reanimated 2 will perform better, but you need additional configuration and need to use Hermes with Flipper to debug.\n\nThis defaults to `true` in the following cases:\n\n- Reanimated 2 is not configured\n- App is connected to Chrome debugger (Reanimated 2 cannot be used with Chrome debugger)\n- App is running on Web\n\nOtherwise, it defaults to `false`\n\n#### `drawerContent`\n\nFunction that returns React element to render as the content of the drawer, for example, navigation items\n\nThe content component receives the following props by default:\n\n- `state` - The [navigation state](navigation-state.md) of the navigator.\n- `navigation` - The navigation object for the navigator.\n- `descriptors` - An descriptor object containing options for the drawer screens. The options can be accessed at `descriptors[route.key].options`.\n\n##### Providing a custom `drawerContent`\n\nThe default component for the drawer is scrollable and only contains links for the routes in the RouteConfig. You can easily override the default component to add a header, footer, or other content to the drawer. The default content component is exported as `DrawerContent`. It renders a `DrawerItemList` component inside a `ScrollView`.\n\nBy default, the drawer is scrollable and supports devices with notches. If you customize the content, you can use `DrawerContentScrollView` to handle this automatically:\n\n```js\nimport {\n  DrawerContentScrollView,\n  DrawerItemList,\n} from '@react-navigation/drawer';\n\nfunction CustomDrawerContent(props) {\n  return (\n    <DrawerContentScrollView {...props}>\n      <DrawerItemList {...props} />\n    </DrawerContentScrollView>\n  );\n}\n```\n\nTo add additional items in the drawer, you can use the `DrawerItem` component:\n\n<samp id=\"custom-drawer-content\" />\n\n```js\nfunction CustomDrawerContent(props) {\n  return (\n    <DrawerContentScrollView {...props}>\n      <DrawerItemList {...props} />\n      <DrawerItem\n        label=\"Help\"\n        onPress={() => Linking.openURL('https://mywebsite.com/help')}\n      />\n    </DrawerContentScrollView>\n  );\n}\n```\n\nThe `DrawerItem` component accepts the following props:\n\n- `label` (required): The label text of the item. Can be string, or a function returning a react element. e.g. `({ focused, color }) => <Text style={{ color }}>{focused ? 'Focused text' : 'Unfocused text'}</Text>`.\n- `icon`: Icon to display for the item. Accepts a function returning a react element. e.g. `({ focused, color, size }) => <Icon color={color} size={size} name={focused ? 'heart' : 'heart-outline'} />`.\n- `focused`: Boolean indicating whether to highlight the drawer item as active.\n- `onPress` (required): Function to execute on press.\n- `activeTintColor`: Color for the icon and label when the item is active.\n- `inactiveTintColor`: Color for the icon and label when the item is inactive.\n- `activeBackgroundColor`: Background color for item when it's active.\n- `inactiveBackgroundColor`: Background color for item when it's inactive.\n- `labelStyle`: Style object for the label `Text`.\n- `style`: Style object for the wrapper `View`.\n\nThe `progress` object can be used to do interesting animations in your `drawerContent`, such as parallax motion of the drawer contents:\n\n<samp id=\"animated-drawer-content\" />\n\n```js\nfunction CustomDrawerContent(props) {\n  const progress = useDrawerProgress();\n\n  // If you are on react-native-reanimated 1.x, use `Animated.interpolate` instead of `Animated.interpolateNode`\n  const translateX = Animated.interpolateNode(progress, {\n    inputRange: [0, 1],\n    outputRange: [-100, 0],\n  });\n\n  return (\n    <Animated.View style={{ transform: [{ translateX }] }}>\n      {/* ... drawer contents */}\n    </Animated.View>\n  );\n}\n```\n\nThe `progress` object is a Reanimated `Node` if you're using Reanimated 1 (see [`useLegacyImplementation`](#uselegacyimplementation)), otherwise a `SharedValue`. It represents the animated position of the drawer (0 is closed; 1 is open).\n\nNote that you **cannot** use the `useNavigation` hook inside the `drawerContent` since `useNavigation` is only available inside screens. You get a `navigation` prop for your `drawerContent` which you can use instead:\n\n```js\nfunction CustomDrawerContent({ navigation }) {\n  return (\n    <Button\n      title=\"Go somewhere\"\n      onPress={() => {\n        // Navigate using the `navigation` prop that you received\n        navigation.navigate('SomeScreen');\n      }}\n    />\n  );\n}\n```\n\nTo use the custom component, we need to pass it in the `drawerContent` prop:\n\n```js\n<Drawer.Navigator drawerContent={(props) => <CustomDrawerContent {...props} />}>\n  {/* screens */}\n</Drawer.Navigator>\n```\n\n### Options\n\nThe following [options](screen-options.md) can be used to configure the screens in the navigator. These can be specified under `screenOptions` prop of `Drawer.navigator` or `options` prop of `Drawer.Screen`.\n\n#### `title`\n\nA generic title that can be used as a fallback for `headerTitle` and `drawerLabel`.\n\n#### `lazy`\n\nWhether this screen should render the first time it's accessed. Defaults to `true`. Set it to `false` if you want to render the screen on initial render.\n\n#### `drawerLabel`\n\nString or a function that given `{ focused: boolean, color: string }` returns a React.Node, to display in drawer sidebar. When undefined, scene `title` is used.\n\n#### `drawerIcon`\n\nFunction, that given `{ focused: boolean, color: string, size: number }` returns a React.Node to display in drawer sidebar.\n\n#### `drawerActiveTintColor`\n\nColor for the icon and label in the active item in the drawer.\n\n#### `drawerActiveBackgroundColor`\n\nBackground color for the active item in the drawer.\n\n#### `drawerInactiveTintColor`\n\nColor for the icon and label in the inactive items in the drawer.\n\n#### `drawerInactiveBackgroundColor`\n\nBackground color for the inactive items in the drawer.\n\n#### `drawerItemStyle`\n\nStyle object for the single item, which can contain an icon and/or a label.\n\n#### `drawerLabelStyle`\n\nStyle object to apply to the `Text` style inside content section which renders a label.\n\n#### `drawerContentContainerStyle`\n\nStyle object for the content section inside the `ScrollView`.\n\n#### `drawerContentStyle`\n\nStyle object for the wrapper view.\n\n#### `drawerStyle`\n\nStyle object for the drawer component. You can pass a custom background color for a drawer or a custom width here.\n\n<samp id=\"drawer-with-style\" />\n\n```js\n<Drawer.Navigator\n  screenOptions={{\n    drawerStyle: {\n      backgroundColor: '#c6cbef',\n      width: 240,\n    },\n  }}\n>\n  {/* screens */}\n</Drawer.Navigator>\n```\n\n#### `drawerPosition`\n\nOptions are `left` or `right`. Defaults to `left` for LTR languages and `right` for RTL languages.\n\n#### `drawerType`\n\nType of the drawer. It determines how the drawer looks and animates.\n\n- `front`: Traditional drawer which covers the screen with an overlay behind it.\n- `back`: The drawer is revealed behind the screen on swipe.\n- `slide`: Both the screen and the drawer slide on swipe to reveal the drawer.\n- `permanent`: A permanent drawer is shown as a sidebar. Useful for having always visible drawer on larger screens.\n\nDefaults to `slide` on iOS and `front` on other platforms.\n\nYou can conditionally specify the `drawerType` to show a permanent drawer on bigger screens and a traditional drawer drawer on small screens:\n\n```js\nimport { useWindowDimensions } from 'react-native';\nimport { createDrawerNavigator } from '@react-navigation/drawer';\n\nconst Drawer = createDrawerNavigator();\n\nfunction MyDrawer() {\n  const dimensions = useWindowDimensions();\n\n  return (\n    <Drawer.Navigator\n      screenOptions={{\n        drawerType: dimensions.width >= 768 ? 'permanent' : 'front',\n      }}\n    >\n      {/* Screens */}\n    </Drawer.Navigator>\n  );\n}\n```\n\nYou can also specify other props such as `drawerStyle` based on screen size to customize the behavior. For example, you can combine it with `defaultStatus=\"open\"` to achieve a master-detail layout:\n\n```js\nimport { useWindowDimensions } from 'react-native';\nimport { createDrawerNavigator } from '@react-navigation/drawer';\n\nconst Drawer = createDrawerNavigator();\n\nfunction MyDrawer() {\n  const dimensions = useWindowDimensions();\n\n  const isLargeScreen = dimensions.width >= 768;\n\n  return (\n    <Drawer.Navigator\n      defaultStatus=\"open\"\n      screenOptions={{\n        drawerType: isLargeScreen ? 'permanent' : 'back',\n        drawerStyle: isLargeScreen ? null : { width: '100%' },\n        overlayColor: 'transparent',\n      }}\n    >\n      {/* Screens */}\n    </Drawer.Navigator>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n#### `drawerHideStatusBarOnOpen`\n\nWhen set to `true`, Drawer will hide the OS status bar whenever the drawer is pulled or when it's in an \"open\" state.\n\n#### `drawerStatusBarAnimation`\n\nAnimation of the statusbar when hiding it. use in combination with `hideStatusBar`.\n\nSupported values:\n\n- `slide`\n- `fade`\n- `none`\n\nThis is only supported on iOS. Defaults to `slide`.\n\n#### `overlayColor`\n\nColor overlay to be displayed on top of the content view when drawer gets open. The opacity is animated from `0` to `1` when the drawer opens.\n\n#### `sceneContainerStyle`\n\nStyle object for the component wrapping the screen content.\n\n#### `gestureHandlerProps`\n\nProps to pass to the underlying pan gesture handler.\n\nThis is not supported on Web.\n\n#### `swipeEnabled`\n\nWhether you can use swipe gestures to open or close the drawer. Defaults to `true`.\n\nSwipe gesture is not supported on Web.\n\n#### `swipeEdgeWidth`\n\nAllows for defining how far from the edge of the content view the swipe gesture should activate.\n\nThis is not supported on Web.\n\n#### `swipeMinDistance`\n\nMinimum swipe distance threshold that should activate opening the drawer.\n\n#### `keyboardDismissMode`\n\nWhether the keyboard should be dismissed when the swipe gesture begins. Defaults to `'on-drag'`. Set to `'none'` to disable keyboard handling.\n\n#### `unmountOnBlur`\n\nWhether this screen should be unmounted when navigating away from it. Unmounting a screen resets any local state in the screen as well as state of nested navigators in the screen. Defaults to `false`.\n\nNormally, we don't recommend enabling this prop as users don't expect their navigation history to be lost when switching screens. If you enable this prop, please consider if this will actually provide a better experience for the user.\n\n#### `freezeOnBlur`\n\nBoolean indicating whether to prevent inactive screens from re-rendering. Defaults to `false`.\nDefaults to `true` when `enableFreeze()` from `react-native-screens` package is run at the top of the application.\n\nRequires `react-native-screens` version >=3.16.0.\n\nOnly supported on iOS and Android.\n\n### Header related options\n\nYou can find the list of header related options [here](elements.md#header). These [options](screen-options.md) can be specified under `screenOptions` prop of `Drawer.navigator` or `options` prop of `Drawer.Screen`. You don't have to be using `@react-navigation/elements` directly to use these options, they are just documented in that page.\n\nIn addition to those, the following options are also supported in drawer:\n\n#### `header`\n\nCustom header to use instead of the default header.\n\nThis accepts a function that returns a React Element to display as a header. The function receives an object containing the following properties as the argument:\n\n- `navigation` - The navigation object for the current screen.\n- `route` - The route object for the current screen.\n- `options` - The options for the current screen\n- `layout` - Dimensions of the screen, contains `height` and `width` properties.\n\nExample:\n\n```js\nimport { getHeaderTitle } from '@react-navigation/elements';\n\n// ..\n\nheader: ({ navigation, route, options }) => {\n  const title = getHeaderTitle(options, route.name);\n\n  return <MyHeader title={title} style={options.headerStyle} />;\n};\n```\n\nTo set a custom header for all the screens in the navigator, you can specify this option in the `screenOptions` prop of the navigator.\n\n##### Specify a `height` in `headerStyle`\n\nIf your custom header's height differs from the default header height, then you might notice glitches due to measurement being async. Explicitly specifying the height will avoid such glitches.\n\nExample:\n\n```js\nheaderStyle: {\n  height: 80, // Specify the height of your custom header\n};\n```\n\nNote that this style is not applied to the header by default since you control the styling of your custom header. If you also want to apply this style to your header, use `options.headerStyle` from the props.\n\n#### `headerShown`\n\nWhether to show or hide the header for the screen. The header is shown by default. Setting this to `false` hides the header.\n\n### Events\n\nThe navigator can [emit events](navigation-events.md) on certain actions. Supported events are:\n\n#### `drawerItemPress`\n\nThis event is fired when the user presses the button for the screen in the drawer. By default a drawer item press does several things:\n\n- If the screen is not focused, drawer item press will focus that screen\n- If the screen is already focused, then it'll close the drawer\n\nTo prevent the default behavior, you can call `event.preventDefault`:\n\n```js\nReact.useEffect(() => {\n  const unsubscribe = navigation.addListener('drawerItemPress', (e) => {\n    // Prevent default behavior\n    e.preventDefault();\n\n    // Do something manually\n    // ...\n  });\n\n  return unsubscribe;\n}, [navigation]);\n```\n\nIf you have custom drawer content, make sure to emit this event.\n\n### Helpers\n\nThe drawer navigator adds the following methods to the navigation prop:\n\n#### `openDrawer`\n\nOpens the drawer pane.\n\n<samp id=\"drawer-open-close-toggle\" />\n\n```js\nnavigation.openDrawer();\n```\n\n#### `closeDrawer`\n\nCloses the drawer pane.\n\n<samp id=\"drawer-open-close-toggle\" />\n\n```js\nnavigation.closeDrawer();\n```\n\n#### `toggleDrawer`\n\nOpens the drawer pane if closed, closes the drawer pane if opened.\n\n<samp id=\"drawer-open-close-toggle\" />\n\n```js\nnavigation.toggleDrawer();\n```\n\n#### `jumpTo`\n\nNavigates to an existing screen in the drawer navigator. The method accepts the following arguments:\n\n- `name` - _string_ - Name of the route to jump to.\n- `params` - _object_ - Screen params to pass to the destination route.\n\n<samp id=\"drawer-jump-to\" />\n\n```js\nnavigation.jumpTo('Profile', { owner: 'Satya' });\n```\n\n## Example\n\n<samp id=\"drawer-example\" />\n\n```js\nimport { createDrawerNavigator } from '@react-navigation/drawer';\n\nconst Drawer = createDrawerNavigator();\n\nfunction MyDrawer() {\n  return (\n    <Drawer.Navigator initialRouteName=\"Feed\">\n      <Drawer.Screen\n        name=\"Feed\"\n        component={Feed}\n        options={{ drawerLabel: 'Home' }}\n      />\n      <Drawer.Screen\n        name=\"Notifications\"\n        component={Notifications}\n        options={{ drawerLabel: 'Updates' }}\n      />\n      <Drawer.Screen\n        name=\"Profile\"\n        component={Profile}\n        options={{ drawerLabel: 'Profile' }}\n      />\n    </Drawer.Navigator>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n## Checking if the drawer is open\n\nYou can check if the drawer is open by using the `useDrawerStatus` hook.\n\n```js\nimport { useDrawerStatus } from '@react-navigation/drawer';\n\n// ...\n\nconst isDrawerOpen = useDrawerStatus() === 'open';\n```\n\nIf you can't use the hook, you can also use the `getDrawerStatusFromState` helper:\n\n```js\nimport { getDrawerStatusFromState } from '@react-navigation/drawer';\n\n// ...\n\nconst isDrawerOpen = getDrawerStatusFromState(navigation.getState()) === 'open';\n```\n\nFor class components, you can listen to the `state` event to check if drawer was opened or closed:\n\n```js\nclass Profile extends React.Component {\n  componentDidMount() {\n    this._unsubscribe = navigation.addListener('state', () => {\n      const isDrawerOpen =\n        getDrawerStatusFromState(navigation.getState()) === 'open';\n\n      // do something\n    });\n  }\n\n  componentWillUnmount() {\n    this._unsubscribe();\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    // Content of the component\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Nesting drawer navigators inside others\n\nIf a drawer navigator is nested inside of another navigator that provides some UI, for example, a tab navigator or stack navigator, then the drawer will be rendered below the UI from those navigators.
