Provides a way for your app to transition between screens where each new screen is placed on top of a stack.

By default the stack navigator is configured to have the familiar iOS and Android look & feel: new screens slide in from the right on iOS, fade in from the bottom on Android. On iOS the stack navigator can also be configured to a modal style where screens slide in from the bottom.

To use this navigator, you need to install [`@react-navigation/stack`](https://github.com/navigation-ex/packages/stack):

```sh
yarn add @react-navigation/core@next @react-navigation/stack@next @react-native-community/masked-view
```

Now we need to install [`react-native-gesture-handler`](https://github.com/kmagiera/react-native-gesture-handler), [`react-native-reanimated`](https://github.com/kmagiera/react-native-reanimated) and [`react-native-screens`](https://github.com/kmagiera/react-native-screens).

If you are using Expo, to ensure that you get the compatible versions of the libraries, run:

```sh
expo install react-native-gesture-handler react-native-reanimated react-native-screens
```

If you are not using Expo, run the following:

```sh
yarn add react-native-gesture-handler react-native-reanimated react-native-screens
```

If you are using Expo, you are done. Otherwise, continue to the next steps.

Next, we need to link these libraries. The steps depends on your React Native version:

- **React Native 0.60 and higher**

  On newer versions of React Native, [linking is automatic](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli/blob/master/docs/autolinking.md).

  To complete the linking on iOS, make sure you have [Cocoapods](https://cocoapods.org/) installed. Then run:

  ```sh
  cd ios
  pod install
  cd ..
  ```

- **React Native 0.59 and lower**

  If you're on an older React Native version, you need to manually link the dependencies. To do that, run:

  ```sh
  react-native link react-native-reanimated
  react-native link react-native-gesture-handler
  ```

To finalize installation of `react-native-gesture-handler` for Android, be sure to make the necessary modifications to `MainActivity.java`:

```diff
package com.reactnavigation.example;

import com.facebook.react.ReactActivity;
+ import com.facebook.react.ReactActivityDelegate;
+ import com.facebook.react.ReactRootView;
+ import com.swmansion.gesturehandler.react.RNGestureHandlerEnabledRootView;

public class MainActivity extends ReactActivity {

  @Override
  protected String getMainComponentName() {
    return "Example";
  }

+  @Override
+  protected ReactActivityDelegate createReactActivityDelegate() {
+    return new ReactActivityDelegate(this, getMainComponentName()) {
+      @Override
+      protected ReactRootView createRootView() {
+       return new RNGestureHandlerEnabledRootView(MainActivity.this);
+      }
+    };
+  }
}
```

Finally, run `react-native run-android` or `react-native run-ios` to launch the app on your device/simulator.

## API Definition

To use this navigator, import it from `@react-navigation/stack`:

```js
import { createStackNavigator } from '@react-navigation/stack';

const Stack = createStackNavigator();

function App() {
  return (
    <Stack.Navigator>
      <Stack.Screen name="Home" component={Home} />
      <Stack.Screen name="Notifications" component={Notifications} />
      <Stack.Screen name="Profile" component={Profile} />
      <Stack.Screen name="Settings" component={Settings} />
    </Stack.Navigator>
  );
}
```

### Props

The `Stack.Navigator` component accepts following props:

#### `initialRouteName`

The name of the route to render on first load of the navigator.

#### `screenOptions`

Default options to use for the screens in the navigator.

#### `keyboardHandlingEnabled`

If `false`, the on screen keyboard will NOT automatically dismiss when navigating to a new screen. Defaults to `true`.

#### `mode`

Defines the style for rendering and transitions:

- `card` - Use the standard iOS and Android screen transitions. This is the default.
- `modal` - Make the screens slide in from the bottom which is a common iOS pattern. Only works on iOS, has no effect on Android.

#### `headerMode`

Specifies how the header should be rendered:

- `float` - Render a single header that stays at the top and animates as screens are changed. This is a common pattern on iOS.
- `screen` - Each screen has a header attached to it and the header fades in and out together with the screen. This is a common pattern on Android.
- `none` - No header will be rendered.

### Options for `Stack.Screen`

The `options` prop can be used to configure individual screens inside the navigator. Supported options are:

#### `title`

String that can be used as a fallback for `headerTitle`.

#### `header`

Function that given `HeaderProps` returns a React Element, to display as a header. Setting to `null` hides header.

#### `headerTitle`

String or a function that returns a React Element to be used by the header. Defaults to scene `title`. When a function is specified, it receives `allowFontScaling`, `onLayout`, `style` and `children` as the arguments. The title string is passed in `children`.

#### `headerTitleAllowFontScaling`

Whether header title font should scale to respect Text Size accessibility settings. Defaults to false.

#### `headerBackAllowFontScaling`

Whether back button title font should scale to respect Text Size accessibility settings. Defaults to false.

#### `headerBackImage`

Function which returns a React Element to display custom image in header's back button. When a function is used, it receives the `tintColor` in it's argument object. Defaults to Image component with back image source, which is the default back icon image for the platform (a chevron on iOS and an arrow on Android).

#### `headerBackTitle`

Title string used by the back button on iOS, or `null` to disable label. Defaults to the previous scene's `headerTitle`.

#### `headerBackTitleVisible`

A reasonable default is supplied for whether the back button title should be visible or not, but if you want to override that you can use `true` or `false` in this option.

#### `headerTruncatedBackTitle`

Title string used by the back button when `headerBackTitle` doesn't fit on the screen. `"Back"` by default.

#### `headerRight`

Function which returns a React Element to display on the right side of the header.

#### `headerLeft`

Function which returns a React Element to display on the left side of the header. When a function is used, it receives a number of arguments when rendered (`onPress`, `label`, `labelStyle` and more - check [types.tsx](https://github.com/react-navigation/stack/blob/master/src/types.tsx) for the complete list).

#### `headerStyle`

Style object for the header. You can specify a custom background color here, for example.

#### `headerStatusBarHeight`

Allows to pass a custom status bar height to set as the top padding in the header.

#### `headerTitleStyle`

Style object for the title component

#### `headerBackTitleStyle`

Style object for the back title

#### `headerLeftContainerStyle`

Customize the style for the container of the `headerLeft` component, for example to add padding.

#### `headerRightContainerStyle`

Customize the style for the container of the `headerRight` component, for example to add padding.

#### `headerTitleContainerStyle`

Customize the style for the container of the `headerTitle` component, for example to add padding.

By default, `headerTitleContainerStyle` is with an absolute position style and offsets both `left` and `right`. This may lead to white space or overlap between `headerLeft` and `headerTitle` if a customized `headerLeft` is used. It can be solved by adjusting `left` and `right` style in `headerTitleContainerStyle` and `marginHorizontal` in `headerTitleStyle`.

#### `headerTintColor`

Tint color for the header

#### `headerPressColorAndroid`

Color for material ripple (Android >= 5.0 only)

#### `headerTransparent`

Defaults to `false`. If `true`, the header will not have a background unless you explicitly provide it with `headerBackground`. The header will also float over the screen so that it overlaps the content underneath.

This is useful if you want to render a semi-transparent header or a blurred background.

Note that if you don't want your content to appear under the header, you need to manually add a top margin to your content. React Navigation won't do it automatically.

#### `headerBackground`

Function which returns a React Element to render as the background of the header. This is useful for using backgrounds such as an image or a gradient.

You can use this with `headerTransparent` to render a blur view, for example, to create a translucent header.

#### `cardShadowEnabled`

Use this prop to have visible shadows during transitions. Defaults to `true`.

#### `cardOverlayEnabled`

Use this prop to have a semi-transparent dark overlay visible under the card during transitions. Defaults to `true` on Android and `false` on iOS.

#### `cardTransparent`

Use this prop to use a transparent background for the card instead of a white one. This is useful to implement things like modal dialogs where the previous scene should still be visible underneath the current one. Defaults to `false`.

If you use [`react-native-screens`](https://github.com/kmagiera/react-native-screens), you should also specify `mode: 'modal'` in the stack view config so previous screens aren't detached.

#### `cardStyle`

Style object for the card in stack. You can provide a custom background color to use instead of the default background here.

#### `animationEnabled`

Whether transition animation should be enabled the screen. If you set it to `false`, the screen won't animate when pushing or popping. Defaults to `true`.

#### `gestureEnabled`

Whether you can use gestures to dismiss this screen. Defaults to `true` on iOS, `false` on Android.

#### `gestureResponseDistance`

Object to override the distance of touch start from the edge of the screen to recognize gestures. It takes the following properties:

- `horizontal` - _number_ - Distance for horizontal direction. Defaults to 25.
- `vertical` - _number_ - Distance for vertical direction. Defaults to 135.

#### `gestureDirection`

Direction of the gesture. Refer the [Animations section](#animations) for details.

#### `transitionSpec`

Configuration object for the screen transition. Refer the [Animations section](#animations) for details.

#### `cardStyleInterpolator`

Interpolated styles for various parts of the card. Refer the [Animations section](#animations) for details.

#### `headerStyleInterpolator`

Interpolated styles for various parts of the header. Refer the [Animations section](#animations) for details.

### Events

The navigator can emit events on certain actions. Supported events are:

#### `transitionStart`

This event is fired when the transition animation starts for the current screen.

#### `transitionEnd`

This event is fired when the transition animation ends for the current screen.

## Example

```js
import { createStackNavigator } from '@react-navigation/stack';

const Stack = createStackNavigator();

function App() {
  return (
    <Stack.Navigator
      initialRouteName="Home"
      headerMode="screen"
      screenOptions={{
        headerTintColor: 'white',
        headerStyle: { backgroundColor: 'tomato' },
      }}
    >
      <Stack.Screen
        name="Home"
        component={Home}
        options={{
          title: 'Awesome app',
        }}
      />
      <Stack.Screen
        name="Profile"
        component={Profile}
        options={{
          title: 'My profile',
        }}
      />
      <Stack.Screen
        name="Settings"
        component={Settings}
        options={{
          gestureEnabled: false,
        }}
      />
    </Stack.Navigator>
  );
}
```

## Animations

Stack Navigator exposes various options to configure the transition animation when a screen is added or removed. These transition animations can be customize on a per-screen basis by specifying the options in the `options` prop for each screen.

- `gestureDirection` - The direction of swipe gestures, `horizontal`, `vertical` or `vertical-inverted`.
- `transitionSpec` - An object which specifies the animation type (`timing` or `spring`) and their options (such as `duration` for `timing`). It takes 2 properties:

  - `open` - Configuration for the transition when adding a screen
  - `close` - Configuration for the transition when removing a screen.

  Each of the object should specify 2 properties:

  - `animation` - The animation function to use for the animation. Supported values are `timing` and `spring`.
  - `config` - The configuration object for the timing function. For `timing`, it can be `duration` and `easing`. For `spring`, it can be `stiffness`, `damping`, `mass`, `overshootClamping`, `restDisplacementThreshold` and `restSpeedThreshold`.

  A config which uses spring animation looks like this:

  ```js
  {
    animation: 'spring',
    config: {
      stiffness: 1000,
      damping: 500,
      mass: 3,
      overshootClamping: true,
      restDisplacementThreshold: 0.01,
      restSpeedThreshold: 0.01,
    },
  }
  ```

- `cardStyleInterpolator` - This is a function which specifies interpolated styles for various parts of the card. Is expected to return at least empty object, possibly containing interpolated styles for container, the card itself, overlay and shadow. Supported properties are:

  - `containerStyle` - Style for the container view wrapping the card.
  - `cardStyle` - Style for the view representing the card.
  - `overlayStyle` - Style for the view representing the semi-transparent overlay below
  - `shadowStyle` - Style for the view representing the card shadow.

  The function receives the following properties in it's argument:

  - `current` - Values for the current screen:
    - `progress` - Progress value of the current screen.
  - `next` - Values for the screen after this one in the stack. This can be `undefined` in case the screen animating is the last one:
    - `progress` - Progress value of the next screen.
  - `index` - The index of the card in the stack.
  - `closing` - Animated node representing whether the card is closing. `1` when closing, `0` if not.
  - `layouts` - Layout measurements for various items we use for animation.
    - `screen` - Layout of the whole screen. Contains `height` and `width` properties.

  A config which just fades the card looks like this:

  ```js
  const forFade = ({ progress, closing }) => ({
    cardStyle: {
      opacity: cond(
        closing,
        progress.current,
        interpolate(progress.current, {
          inputRange: [0, 0.5, 0.9, 1],
          outputRange: [0, 0.25, 0.7, 1],
        })
      ),
    },
  });
  ```

- `headerStyleInterpolator` - This is a function which specifies interpolated styles for various parts of the header. Is expected to return at least empty object, possibly containing interpolated styles for left label and button, right button, title and background. Supported properties are:

  - `leftLabelStyle` - Style for the label of the left button (back button label).
  - `leftButtonStyle` - Style for the left button (usually the back button).
  - `rightButtonStyle` - Style for the right button.
  - `titleStyle` - Style for the header title text.
  - `backgroundStyle` - Style for the header background.

  The function receives the following properties in it's argument:

  - `current` - Values for the current screen:
    - `progress` - Progress value of the current screen (the screen which owns this header).
  - `next` - Values for the screen after this one in the stack. This can be `undefined` in case the screen animating is the last one:
    - `progress` - Progress value of the next screen.
  - `layouts` - Layout measurements for various items we use for animation. Each layout object contain `height` and `width` properties.
    - `screen` - Layout of the whole screen.
    - `title` - Layout of the title element. Might be `undefined` when not rendering a title.
    - `leftLabel` - Layout of the back button label. Might be `undefined` when not rendering a back button label.

  A config which just fades the elements looks like this:

  ```js
  const forFade = ({ progress }) => {
    const opacity = interpolate(
      add(progress.current, progress.next ? progress.next : 0),
      {
        inputRange: [0, 1, 2],
        outputRange: [0, 1, 0],
      }
    );

    return {
      leftButtonStyle: { opacity },
      rightButtonStyle: { opacity },
      titleStyle: { opacity },
      backgroundStyle: { opacity },
    };
  };
  ```

With these options, it's possible to build custom transition animations for screens. We also export various configs from the library with ready-made animations which you can use:

- `TransitionSpecs`

  - `TransitionIOSSpec` - Exact values from UINavigationController's animation configuration.
  - `FadeInFromBottomAndroidSpec` - Configuration for activity open animation from Android Nougat.
  - `FadeOutToBottomAndroidSpec` - Configuration for activity close animation from Android Nougat.
  - `RevealFromBottomAndroidSpec` - Approximate configuration for activity open animation from Android Pie.

- `CardStyleInterpolators`

  - `forHorizontalIOS` - Standard iOS-style slide in from the right.
  - `forVerticalIOS` - Standard iOS-style slide in from the bottom (used for modals).
  - `forModalPresentationIOS` - Standard iOS-style modal animation in iOS 13.
  - `forFadeFromBottomAndroid` - Standard Android-style fade in from the bottom for Android Oreo.
  - `forRevealFromBottomAndroid` - Standard Android-style reveal from the bottom for Android Pie.

- `HeaderStyleInterpolators`

  - `forUIKit` - Standard UIKit style animation for the header where the title fades into the back button label.
  - `forFade` - Simple fade animation for the header elements.
  - `forStatic` - Simple translate animation to translate the header along with the sliding screen.

**IMPORTANT**: Always define your animation configuration at the top-level of the file to ensure that the references don't change across re-renders. This is important for smooth and reliable transition animations.

We export various transition presets (under `TransitionPresets`) which bundle various set of these options together to match certain native animations:

- `SlideFromRightIOS` - Standard iOS navigation transition.
- `ModalSlideFromBottomIOS` - Standard iOS navigation transition for modals.
- `ModalPresentationIOS` - Standard iOS modal presentation style (introduced in iOS 13).
- `FadeFromBottomAndroid` - Standard Android navigation transition when opening or closing an Activity on Android < 9 (Oreo).
- `RevealFromBottomAndroid` - Standard Android navigation transition when opening or closing an Activity on Android >= 9 (Pie).
- `DefaultTransition` - Default navigation transition for the current platform.
- `ModalTransition` - Default modal transition for the current platform.

You can spread these presets in `options` to customize the animation for a screen:

```js
<Stack.Screen
  name="Profile"
  component={Profile}
  options={{
    title: 'Profile',
    ...TransitionSpecs.ModalSlideFromBottomIOS,
  }}
/>
```

If you want to customize the transition animations for all of the screens in the navigator, you can specify it in `screenOptions` prop for the navigator.

Example configuration for iOS modal presentation style:

```js
<Stack.Navigator
  initialRouteName="Home"
  screenOptions={{
    ...TransitionPresets.ModalPresentationIOS,
    gestureEnabled: true,
    cardOverlayEnabled: true,
  }}
>
  <Stack.Screen name="Home" component={Home} />
  <Stack.Screen name="Profile" component={Profile} />
  <Stack.Screen name="Settings" component={Settings} />
</Stack.Navigator>
```
