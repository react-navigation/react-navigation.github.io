Routers define a component's navigation state, and they allow the developer to define paths and actions that can be handled.

## Built-In Routers

`@react-navigation/routers` ships with a few standard routers:

- `StackRouter`
- `TabRouter`
- `DrawerRouter`

- [StackRouter](https://github.com/react-navigation/react-navigation-core/blob/master/src/routers/StackRouter.js)
- [TabRouter](https://github.com/react-navigation/react-navigation-core/blob/master/src/routers/TabRouter.js)
