It is extremely easy to use Redux in an app with React Navigation. It's basically no different than without React Navigation. The following example shows how to do it end to end: https://snack.expo.io/@react-navigation/redux-example. The most important piece from it is the following:

```js
import { Provider } from 'react-redux';
import { NavigationNativeContainer } from '@react-navigation/native';

// Render the app container component with the provider around it
export default class App() {
  return (
    <Provider store={store}>
      <NavigationNativeContainer>
        {/* Screen configuration */}
      </NavigationNativeContainer>
    </Provider>
  );
}
```

Notice that we wrap our components in a `Provider` like we'd normally do with `react-redux`. Ta da! Now feel free to use `connect` throughout your app.

### Use a component that is `connect`ed in `options`

Create a component, `connect` it to the store, then use that component in the `title`.

```js
function Count({ value }) {
  return <Text>Count: {value}</Text>;
}

const CountContainer = connect(state => ({ value: state.count }))(Count);
```

```js
<Screen
  name="Test"
  component={TestScreen}
  options={{ title: () => <CountContainer /> }}
/>
```

### Pass the state you care about as a param to the screen

If the value isn't expected to change, you can just pass it from a `connect`ed component to the other screen as a param.

```js
<Button
  title="Go to static count screen"
  onPress={() =>
    props.navigation.navigate('StaticCounter', {
      count: props.count,
    })
  }
/>
```

```js
function StaticCounter({ route }) {
  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Text style={styles.paragraph}>{route.params.count}</Text>
    </View>
  );
}
```

```js
<Screen
  name="Counter"
  component={StaticCounter}
  options={({ route }) => ({ title: () => route.params.count })}
/>
```

### setParams from your screen

Let's modify the `StaticCounter` from the previous example as follows:

```js
function StaticCounter({ count, route, navigation }) {
  React.useEffect(() => {
    navigation.setParams({ count });
  }, [navigation, count]);

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Text style={styles.paragraph}>{route.params.count}</Text>
    </View>
  );
}
```

Now whenever the store updates we update the `count` param and the title updates accordingly.

## Can I store the navigation state in Redux too?

This is not possible. We don't support it because it's too easy to shoot yourself in the foot and slow down / break your app.

However it's possible to use [`redux-devtools-extension`](https://github.com/zalmoxisus/redux-devtools-extension) to inspect the navigation state and actions, as well as perform time travel debugging. This works out of the box without any extra configuration.

If you use [`react-native-debugger`](https://github.com/jhen0409/react-native-debugger), it already includes this extension.
