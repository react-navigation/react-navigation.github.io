`SwitchActions` is an object containing methods for generating actions specific to switch-based navigators. Its methods expand upon the actions available in [NavigationActions](navigation-actions.html).

The following actions are supported:

- [JumpTo](#jumpto) - Jump to a route in the navigator

### jumpTo

The `jumpTo` action can be used to jump to an existing route in the switch navigator.

- `routeName` - _string_ - required - `routeName` of the route to jump to.
- `key` - _string_ - optional - If set, the action will be scoped to the switch-based navigator with the given key.

```js
import { SwitchActions } from 'react-navigation';

this.props.navigation.dispatch(SwitchActions.jumpTo({ routeName }));
```
