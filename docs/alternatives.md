React Navigation isn't your only option for routing and navigation in React Native. If the [pitch & anti-pitch](pitch.html) or the API design leave you wanting to explore other options, here are a few to consider.

- [react-native-router-flux](https://github.com/aksonov/react-native-router-flux): this library is based on React Navigation but provides you with a different API to interact with it.
- [react-native-navigation](https://github.com/wix/react-native-navigation): uses the underlying native APIs on iOS and Android, this is a popular alternative to React Navigation and worth considering if you value adhering to the platform conventions exactly and do not care as much about customization.
