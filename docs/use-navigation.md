`useNavigation` is a hook which gives access to `navigation` object. It's useful when you cannot pass the `navigation` prop into the component directly, or don't want to pass it in case of a deeply nested child.

- `useNavigation()` returns a `navigation` prop.

## Example

```js
import * as React from 'react';
import { Button } from 'react-native';
import { useNavigation } from '@react-navigation/core';

export default function MyBackButton() {
  const navigation = useNavigation();
  return (
    <Button
      title="Back"
      onPress={() => {
        navigation.goBack();
      }}
    />
  );
}
```
