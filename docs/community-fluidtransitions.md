Fluid Transitions is a library that provides Shared Element Transitions during navigation between screens using react-navigation. 

A Shared Element Transition is the visualization of an element in one screen being transformed into a corresponding element in another screen during the navigation transition.

The library implements a custom navigator called `FluidNavigator` that makes all this and more possible. 

## Installation

Install the FluidTransitions package in your project:

```
npm install react-navigation-fluid-transitions
yarn add react-navigation-fluid-transitions
```
