A material-design themed tab bar on the bottom of the screen that lets you switch between different routes. Routes are lazily initialized -- their screen components are not mounted until they are first focused.

To use this navigator, you need to install `react-navigation-material-bottom-tabs`

```
npm install react-navigation-material-bottom-tabs react-native-paper
```

This API also requires that you install `react-native-vector-icons`! If you are using Expo, it will just work out of the box. Otherwise, [follow these installation instructions](https://github.com/oblador/react-native-vector-icons#installation).

To use this tab navigator, import it from `react-navigation-material-bottom-tabs`

```js
import { createMaterialBottomTabNavigator } from "react-navigation-material-bottom-tabs";

createMaterialBottomTabNavigator(
  RouteConfigs,
  MaterialBottomTabNavigatorConfig
);
```

This library uses the [`BottomNavigation` component from `react-native-paper`](https://callstack.github.io/react-native-paper/bottom-navigation.html). It doesn't include the whole `react-native-paper` library in your bundle, so you don't need to worry about it.

## RouteConfigs

The route configs object is a mapping from route name to a route config.

## MaterialBottomTabNavigatorConfig

* `shifting` - Whether the shifting style is used, the active tab appears wider and the inactive tabs won't have a label. By default, this is `true` when you have more than 3 tabs.
* `labeled` - Whether to show labels in tabs. When `false`, only icons will be displayed.
* `activeColor` - Custom color for icon and label in the active tab.
* `inactiveColor` - Custom color for icon and label in the inactive tab.
* `barStyle` - Style for the bottom navigation bar. You can set a bottom padding here if you have a translucent navigation bar on Android: `barStyle={{ paddingBottom: 48 }}`.
* `initialRouteName` - The routeName for the initial tab route when first loading.
* `order` - Array of routeNames which defines the order of the tabs.
* `paths` - Provide a mapping of routeName to path config, which overrides the paths set in the routeConfigs.
* `backBehavior` - `initialRoute` to return to initial tab, `order` to return to previous tab, `history` to return to last visited tab, or `none`.

Example:

```js
export default createMaterialBottomTabNavigator({
  Album: { screen: Album },
  Library: { screen: Library },
  History: { screen: History },
  Cart: { screen: Cart },
}, {
  initialRouteName: 'Album',
  activeColor: '#f0edf6',
  inactiveColor: '#3e2465',
  barStyle: { backgroundColor: '#694fad' },
});
```

## `navigationOptions` for screens inside of the navigator

#### `title`

Generic title that can be used as a fallback for `headerTitle` and `tabBarLabel`.

#### `tabBarIcon`

React Element or a function that given `{ focused: boolean, horizontal: boolean, tintColor: string }` returns a React.Node, to display in the tab bar. `horizontal` is `true` when the device is in landscape and `false` when portrait. The icon is re-rendered whenever the device orientation changes.

#### `tabBarColor`

Color for the tab bar when the tab corresponding to the screen is active. Used for the ripple effect. This is only supported when `shifting` is `true`.

#### `tabBarLabel`

Title string of a tab displayed in the tab bar. When undefined, scene `title` is used. To hide, see `labeled` option in the previous section.

#### `tabBarAccessibilityLabel`

Accessibility label for the tab button. This is read by the screen reader when the user taps the tab. It's recommended to set this if you don't have a label for the tab.

#### `tabBarTestID`

ID to locate this tab button in tests.

#### `tabBarOnPress`

Callback to handle press events; the argument is an object containing:

* `navigation`: navigation prop for the screen
* `defaultHandler`: the default handler for tab press

Useful for adding a custom logic before the transition to the next scene (the tapped one) starts. When setting tabBarOnPress the defaultHandler needs to be called in order to execute the default action (i.e. switch tab).

## Using with `react-native-paper` (optional)

You can use the theming support in `react-native-paper` to customize the material bottom navigation by wrapping your app in [`Provider` from `react-native-paper`](https://callstack.github.io/react-native-paper/getting-started.html). A common use case for this can be to customize the background color for the screens when your app has a dark theme. Follow the [instructions on `react-native-paper`'s documentation](https://callstack.github.io/react-native-paper/theming.html) to learn how to customize the theme.
