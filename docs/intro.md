React Navigation is born from the React Native community's need for an extensible yet easy-to-use navigation solution written entirely in JavaScript, on top of powerful native primitives.

React Navigation is the result of a collaboration between developers from Facebook, Expo and the React community at large: it replaces and improves upon several navigation libraries in the ecosystem, including Ex-Navigation, React Native's Navigator and NavigationExperimental components.
