`useRoute` is a hook which gives access to `route` object. It's useful when you cannot pass the `route` prop into the component directly, or don't want to pass it in case of a deeply nested child.

- `useRoute()` returns a `route` prop.

## Example

```js
import * as React from 'react';
import { Text } from 'react-native';
import { useRoute } from '@react-navigation/core';

export default function MyText() {
  const route = useRoute();
  return <Text>{route.params.caption}</Text>;
}
```
