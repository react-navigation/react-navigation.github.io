A navigation action is an object containing at least a `type` property. The action can be handled by routers with the `getStateForAction` method to return a new state from an existing navigation state.

Each navigation actions can contain at least the following properties:

- `type` (required) - A string which represents the name of the action.
- `source` (optional) - The route which dispatched the action. This is used by some routers to determine which route to apply the action on. By default, `navigation.dispatch` adds the key of the current route here.
- `target` (optional) - The key of the navigation state the action should be applied on.

It's important to highlight that dispatching a navigation action doesn't throw any error when the action is unhandled (similar to when you dispatch an action that isn't handled by a reducer in redux and nothing happens).

## Common actions

The library exports several action creators under the `CommonActions` namespace. You should use these action creators instead of writing action objects manually.

### navigate

The `navigate` action allows to navigate to a specific route. It takes the following arguments:

- `name` - _string_ - A destination name of the route that has been registered somewhere..
- `key` - _string_ - The identifier for the route to navigate to. Navigate back to this route if it already exists..
- `params` - _object_ - Params to merge into the destination route..

The options object passed should at least contain a `key` or `name` property, and optionally `params`. If both `key` and `name` are passed, stack navigator will create a new route with the specified key if no matches were found.

```js
import { CommonActions } from '@react-navigation/core';

navigation.dispatch(
  CommonActions.navigate({
    name: 'Profile',
    params: {
      user: 'jane',
    },
  })
);
```

### replace

The `replace` action allows to replace a route in the navigation state. It takes the following arguments:

- `name` - _string_ - A destination name of the route that has been registered somewhere.
- `params` - _object_ - Params to merge into the destination route.

```js
import { CommonActions } from '@react-navigation/core';

navigation.dispatch(
  CommonActions.replace({
    name: 'Profile',
    params: {
      user: 'jane',
    },
  })
);
```

If you want to replace a particular route, you can add a `source` property referring to the route key:

```js
import { CommonActions } from '@react-navigation/core';

navigation.dispatch({
  ...CommonActions.replace({
    name: 'Profile',
    params: {
      user: 'jane',
    },
  }),
  source: route.key,
});
```

If the `source` property is explicitly set to `undefined`, it'll replace the focused route.

### reset

The `reset` action allows to reset the navigation state to the given state. It takes the following arguments:

- `state` - _object_ - The new navigation state object to use.

```js
import { CommonActions } from '@react-navigation/core';

navigation.dispatch(
  CommonActions.reset({
    index: 1,
    routes: [{ name: 'foo' }, { name: 'bar' }],
  })
);
```

### goBack

The `goBack` action creator allows to go back to the previous route in history. It doesn't take any arguments.

```js
import { CommonActions } from '@react-navigation/core';

navigation.dispatch(CommonActions.goBack());
```

If you want to go back from a particular route, you can add a `source` property referring to the route key and a `target` property referring to the `key` of the navigator which contains the route:

```js
import { CommonActions } from '@react-navigation/core';

navigation.dispatch({
  ...CommonActions.goBack(),
  source: route.key,
  target: state.key,
});
```

By default, the key of the route which dispatched the action is passed as the `source` property and the `target` property is `undefined`.

### setParams

The `setParams` action allows to update params for a certain route. It takes the following arguments:

- `params` - _object_ - required - New params to be merged into existing route params.

```js
import { CommonActions } from '@react-navigation/core';

navigation.dispatch(CommonActions.setParams({ title: 'Hello' }));
```

If you want to set params for a particular route, you can add a `source` property referring to the route key:

```js
import { CommonActions } from '@react-navigation/core';

navigation.dispatch({
  ...CommonActions.setParams({ title: 'Hello' }),
  source: route.key,
});
```

If the `source` property is explicitly set to `undefined`, it'll set the params for the focused route.
