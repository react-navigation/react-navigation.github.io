The router object provides various helper methods to deal with the state and actions, a reducer to update the state as well as some action creators.

The router is responsible for handling actions dispatched by calling methods on the navigation object. If the router cannot handle an action, it can return `null`, which would propagate the action to other routers until it's handled.

You can make your own router by building an object with the following functions:

- `getInitialState` - Function which returns the initial state for the navigator. Receives an options object with `routeNames` and `routeParamList` properties.
- `getRehydratedState` - Function which rehydrates the full navigation state from a given partial state. Receives a partial state object and an options object with `routeNames` and `routeParamList` properties.
- `getStateForRouteNamesChange` - Function which takes the current state and updated list of route names, and returns a new state. Receives the state object and an options object with `routeNames` and `routeParamList` properties.
- `getStateForAction` - function which takes the current state and action, and returns a new state. If the action cannot be handled, it should return `null`.
- `getStateForRouteFocus` - Function which takes the current state and key of a route, and returns a new state with that route focused.
- `shouldActionChangeFocus` - Function which determines whether the action should also change focus in parent navigator. Some actions such as `NAVIGATE` can change focus in the parent.
- `actionCreators` - Optional object containing a list of action creators, such as `push`, `pop` etc. These will be used to add helper methods to the `navigation` object to dispatch those actions.

Example:

```js
const router = {
  getInitialState({ routeNames, routeParamList }) {
    const index =
      options.initialRouteName === undefined
        ? 0
        : routeNames.indexOf(options.initialRouteName);

    return {
      stale: false,
      key: shortid(),
      index,
      routeNames,
      routes: routeNames.map(name => ({
        name,
        key: name,
        params: routeParamList[name],
      })),
    };
  },

  getRehydratedState(partialState, { routeNames, routeParamList }) {
    const state = partialState;

    if (state.stale === false) {
      return state as NavigationState;
    }

    const routes = state.routes
      .filter(route => routeNames.includes(route.name))
      .map(
        route =>
          ({
            ...route,
            key: route.key || `${route.name}-${shortid()}`,
            params:
              routeParamList[route.name] !== undefined
                ? {
                    ...routeParamList[route.name],
                    ...route.params,
                  }
                : route.params,
          } as Route<string>)
      );

    return {
      stale: false,
      key: shortid(),
      index:
        typeof state.index === 'number' && state.index < routes.length
          ? state.index
          : 0,
      routeNames,
      routes,
    };
  },

  getStateForRouteNamesChange(state, { routeNames }) {
    const routes = state.routes.filter(route =>
      routeNames.includes(route.name)
    );

    return {
      ...state,
      routeNames,
      routes,
      index: Math.min(state.index, routes.length - 1),
    };
  },

  getStateForRouteFocus(state, key) {
    const index = state.routes.findIndex(r => r.key === key);

    if (index === -1 || index === state.index) {
      return state;
    }

    return { ...state, index };
  },

  getStateForAction(state, action) {
    switch (action.type) {
      case 'NAVIGATE': {
        const index = state.routes.findIndex(
          route => route.name === action.payload.name
        );

        if (index === -1) {
          return null;
        }

        return { ...state, index };
      }

      default:
        return BaseRouter.getStateForAction(state, action);
    }
  },

  shouldActionChangeFocus() {
    return false;
  },
};

const SimpleRouter = () => router;

export default SimpleRouter;
```
