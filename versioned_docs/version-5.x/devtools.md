Developer tools to make debugging easier when using React Navigation.

To use the developer tools, install [`@react-navigation/devtools`](https://github.com/react-navigation/react-navigation/tree/master/packages/devtools):

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @react-navigation/devtools@^5.x
```

## API Definition

The package exposes the following APIs:

### `useReduxDevToolsExtension`

This hook provides integration with [Redux DevTools Extension](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-devtools). It also works with [`React Native Debugger app`](https://github.com/jhen0409/react-native-debugger) which includes this extension.

**Usage:**

To use the hook, import it and pass a `ref` to the `NavigationContainer` as its argument:

```js
import * as React from 'react';
import {
  NavigationContainer,
  useNavigationContainerRef,
} from '@react-navigation/native';
import { useReduxDevToolsExtension } from '@react-navigation/devtools';

export default function App() {
  const navigationRef = useNavigationContainerRef();

  useReduxDevToolsExtension(navigationRef);

  return (
    <NavigationContainer ref={navigationRef}>{/* ... */}</NavigationContainer>
  );
}
```

Now, you'll be able to see logs from React Navigation in Redux DevTools Extension, e.g. when you're debugging your app with React Native Debugger app.

The hook only works during development and is disabled in production. You don't need to do anything special to remove it from the production build.
