React Navigation isn't your only option for routing and navigation in React Native. If the [pitch & anti-pitch](pitch.md) or the API design leave you wanting to explore other options, here are a couple to consider.

- [react-native-router-flux](https://github.com/aksonov/react-native-router-flux): this library is based on React Navigation but provides you with a different API to interact with it.
- [react-native-navigation](https://github.com/wix/react-native-navigation): uses the underlying native APIs on iOS and Android, similar to [createNativeStackNavigator](native-stack-navigator.md). This is a popular alternative to React Navigation and may be a better fit for you if you are trying to integrate React Native into an existing large native app.
