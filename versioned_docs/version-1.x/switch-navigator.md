```js
SwitchNavigator(RouteConfigs, SwitchNavigatorConfig)
```

## RouteConfigs

The route configs object is a mapping from route name to a route config, which tells the navigator what to present for that route, see [example](stack-navigator.md#routeconfigs) from `StackNavigator`.

## SwitchNavigatorConfig

Several options get passed to the underlying router to modify navigation logic:

- `initialRouteName` - The routeName for the initial tab route when first loading.
- `resetOnBlur` - Reset the state of any nested navigators when switching away from a screen. Defaults to `true`.
- `paths` - Provide a mapping of routeName to path config, which overrides the paths set in the routeConfigs.
- `backBehavior` - Should the back button cause a tab switch to the initial route? If yes, set to `initialRoute`, otherwise `none`. Defaults to `none` behavior.
