`useNavigationState` is a hook which gives access to the [navigation state](navigation-state.md) of the navigator which contains the screen. It's useful in rare cases where you want to render something based on the navigation state.

> Note: Consider the navigator's state object to be internal and subject to change in a minor release. Avoid using properties from the [navigation state](navigation-state.md) object except `index` and `routes`, unless you really need it. If there is some functionality you cannot achieve without relying on the structure of the state object, please open an issue.

It takes a selector function as an argument. The selector will receive the full [navigation state](navigation-state.md) and can return a specific value from the state:

```js
const index = useNavigationState(state => state.index);
```

The selector function helps to reduce unnecessary re-renders, so your screen will re-render only when that's something you care about. If you actually need the whole state object, you can do this explicitly:

```js
const state = useNavigationState(state => state);
```

> Note: This hook is useful for advanced cases and it's easy to introduce performance issues if you're not careful. For most of the cases, you don't need the navigator's state.

## How is `useNavigationState` different from `navigation.getState()`?

The `navigation.getState()` function also returns the current [navigation state](navigation-state.md). The main difference is that the `useNavigationState` hook will trigger a re-render when values change, while `navigation.getState()` won't. For example, the following code will be incorrect:

```js
function Profile() {
  const routesLength = navigation.getState().routes.length; // Don't do this

  return <Text>Number of routes: {routesLength}</Text>;
}
```

In this example, even if you push a new screen, this text won't update. If you use the hook, it'll work as expected:

<samp id="use-navigation-state" />

```js
function Profile() {
  const routesLength = useNavigationState(state => state.routes.length);

  return <Text>Number of routes: {routesLength}</Text>;
}
```

So when do you use `navigation.getState()`? It's mostly useful within event listeners where you don't care about what's rendered. In most cases, using the hook should be preferred.

## Using with class component

You can wrap your class component in a function component to use the hook:

```js
class Profile extends React.Component {
  render() {
    // Get it from props
    const { routesLength } = this.props;
  }
}

// Wrap and export
export default function(props) {
  const routesLength = useNavigationState(state => state.routes.length);

  return <Profile {...props} routesLength={routesLength} />;
}
```
