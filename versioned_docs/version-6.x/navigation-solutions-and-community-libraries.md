## Solutions built on top of React Navigation

### Solito

A tiny wrapper around React Navigation and Next.js that lets you share navigation code across platforms. Also, it provides a set of patterns and examples for building cross-platform apps with React Native + Next.js.

[Documentation](https://solito.dev/)

### Expo Router

File-based router for React Native apps. With Expo Router pages are automatically generated by simply creating files in a project.

[Documentation](https://expo.github.io/router/docs)

### Navio

A navigation library built on top of React Navigation. It's main goal is to improve DX by building the app layout in one place and using the power of TypeScript to provide route names autocompletion.

## Community libraries

### react-native-screens

This project aims to expose native navigation container components to React Native and React Navigation can integrate with it since version 2.14.0. Using `react-native-screens` brings several benefits, such as support for the ["reachability feature"](https://www.cnet.com/how-to/how-to-use-reachability-on-iphone-6-6-plus/) on iOS, and improved memory consumption on both platforms.

### react-navigation-header-buttons

Helps you to render buttons in the navigation bar and handle the styling so you don't have to. It tries to mimic the appearance of native navbar buttons and attempts to offer a simple interface for you to interact with.

[Demo on expo](https://expo.io/@vonovak/navbar-buttons-demo)

### react-navigation-props-mapper

Provides simple HOCs that map react-navigation props to your screen components directly - ie. instead of `const user = this.props.route.params.activeUser`, you'd write `const user = this.props.activeUser`.
