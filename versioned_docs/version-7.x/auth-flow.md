import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

Most apps require that a user authenticates in some way to have access to data associated with a user or other private content. Typically the flow will look like this:

- The user opens the app.
- The app loads some authentication state from encrypted persistent storage (for example, [`SecureStore`](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/sdk/securestore/)).
- When the state has loaded, the user is presented with either authentication screens or the main app, depending on whether valid authentication state was loaded.
- When the user signs out, we clear the authentication state and send them back to authentication screens.

:::note

We say "authentication screens" because usually there is more than one. You may have a main screen with a username and password field, another for "forgot password", and another set for sign up.

:::

## What we need

We want the following behavior from our authentication flow:

- When the user is signed in, we want to show the main app screens and not the authentication-related screens.
- When the user is signed out, we want to show the authentication screens and not the main app screens.
- After the user goes through the authentication flow and signs in, we want to unmount all of the screens related to authentication, and when we press the hardware back button, we expect to not be able to go back to the authentication flow.

## How it will work

We can configure different screens to be available based on some condition. For example, if the user is signed in, we can define `Home`, `Profile`, `Settings` etc. If the user is not signed in, we can define `SignIn` and `SignUp` screens.

<Tabs groupId="config" queryString="config">
<TabItem value="static" label="Static" default>

To do this, we need a couple of things:

1. Define two hooks: `useIsSignedIn` and `useIsSignedOut`, which return a boolean value indicating whether the user is signed in or not.
2. Use the `useIsSignedIn` and `useIsSignedOut` along with the [`if`](static-configuration.md#if) property to define the screens that are available based on the condition.

This tells React Navigation to show specific screens based on the signed in status. When the signed in status changes, React Navigation will automatically show the appropriate screen.

## Define the hooks

To implement the `useIsSignedIn` and `useIsSignedOut` hooks, we can start by creating a context to store the authentication state. Let's call it `SignInContext`:

```js
import * as React from 'react';

const SignInContext = React.createContext();
```

Then we can implement the `useIsSignedIn` and `useIsSignedOut` hooks as follows:

```js
function useIsSignedIn() {
  const isSignedIn = React.useContext(SignInContext);
  return isSignedIn;
}

function useIsSignedOut() {
  const isSignedIn = React.useContext(SignInContext);
  return !isSignedIn;
}
```

We'll discuss how to expose the context value later.

```js name="Customizing tabs appearance" snack
import * as React from 'react';
import { View } from 'react-native';
import { createStaticNavigation } from '@react-navigation/native';
import { createNativeStackNavigator } from '@react-navigation/native-stack';

const useIsSignedIn = () => {
  return true;
};

const useIsSignedOut = () => {
  return false;
};

const signedInStack = createNativeStackNavigator({
  screens: {
    Home: HomeScreen,
    Profile: ProfileScreen,
    Settings: SettingsScreen,
  },
});

const signedOutStack = createNativeStackNavigator({
  screens: {
    SignIn: SignInScreen,
    SignUp: SignUpScreen,
  },
});

// codeblock-focus-start
const RootStack = createNativeStackNavigator({
  screens: {
    LoggedIn: {
      if: useIsSignedIn,
      screen: signedInStack,
      options: {
        headerShown: false,
      },
    },
    LoggedOut: {
      if: useIsSignedOut,
      screen: signedOutStack,
      options: {
        headerShown: false,
      },
    },
  },
});
// codeblock-focus-end

const Navigation = createStaticNavigation(RootStack);

export default function App() {
  return <Navigation />;
}

function HomeScreen() {
  return <View />;
}

function ProfileScreen() {
  return <View />;
}

function SettingsScreen() {
  return <View />;
}

function SignInScreen() {
  return <View />;
}

function SignUpScreen() {
  return <View />;
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="dynamic" label="Dynamic">

For example:

```js name="Customizing tabs appearance" snack
import * as React from 'react';
import { View } from 'react-native';
import { NavigationContainer } from '@react-navigation/native';
import { createNativeStackNavigator } from '@react-navigation/native-stack';

const Stack = createNativeStackNavigator();

const getIsSignedIn = () => {
  // custom logic
  return true;
};

export default function App() {
  const isSignedIn = getIsSignedIn();

  return (
    <NavigationContainer>
      <Stack.Navigator>
        // codeblock-focus-start
        {isSignedIn ? (
          <>
            <Stack.Screen name="Home" component={HomeScreen} />
            <Stack.Screen name="Profile" component={ProfileScreen} />
            <Stack.Screen name="Settings" component={SettingsScreen} />
          </>
        ) : (
          <>
            <Stack.Screen name="SignIn" component={SignInScreen} />
            <Stack.Screen name="SignUp" component={SignUpScreen} />
          </>
        )}
        // codeblock-focus-end
      </Stack.Navigator>
    </NavigationContainer>
  );
}

function HomeScreen() {
  return <View />;
}

function ProfileScreen() {
  return <View />;
}

function SettingsScreen() {
  return <View />;
}

function SignInScreen() {
  return <View />;
}

function SignUpScreen() {
  return <View />;
}
```

When we define screens like this, when `isSignedIn` is `true`, React Navigation will only see the `Home`, `Profile` and `Settings` screens, and when it's `false`, React Navigation will see the `SignIn` and `SignUp` screens. This makes it impossible to navigate to the `Home`, `Profile` and `Settings` screens when the user is not signed in, and to `SignIn` and `SignUp` screens when the user is signed in.

This pattern has been in use by other routing libraries such as React Router for a long time, and is commonly known as "Protected routes". Here, our screens which need the user to be signed in are "protected" and cannot be navigated to by other means if the user is not signed in.

The magic happens when the value of the `isSignedIn` variable changes. Let's say, initially `isSignedIn` is `false`. This means, either `SignIn` or `SignUp` screens are shown. After the user signs in, the value of `isSignedIn` will change to `true`. React Navigation will see that the `SignIn` and `SignUp` screens are no longer defined and so it will remove them. Then it'll show the `Home` screen automatically because that's the first screen defined when `isSignedIn` is `true`.

The example shows stack navigator, but you can use the same approach with any navigator.

By conditionally defining different screens based on a variable, we can implement auth flow in a simple way that doesn't require additional logic to make sure that the correct screen is shown.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Define our screens

In our navigator, we can conditionally define appropriate screens. For our case, let's say we have 3 screens:

- `SplashScreen` - This will show a splash or loading screen when we're restoring the token.
- `SignIn` - This is the screen we show if the user isn't signed in already (we couldn't find a token).
- `Home` - This is the screen we show if the user is already signed in.

So our navigator will look like:

<Tabs groupId="config" queryString="config">
<TabItem value="static" label="Static" default>

```js
const RootStack = createNativeStackNavigator({
  screens: {
    Home: {
      if: useIsSignedIn,
      screen: HomeScreen,
    },
    SignIn: {
      if: useIsSignedOut,
      screen: SignInScreen,
      options: {
        title: 'Sign in',
      },
    },
  },
});

const Navigation = createStaticNavigation(RootStack);
```

Notice how we have only defined the `Home` and `SignIn` screens here, and not the `SplashScreen`. The `SplashScreen` should be rendered before we render any navigators so that we don't render incorrect screens before we know whether the user is signed in or not.

When we use this in our component, it'd look something like this:

```js
if (isLoading) {
  // We haven't finished checking for the token yet
  return <SplashScreen />;
}

const isSignedIn = userToken != null;

return (
  <SignInContext.Provider value={isSignedIn}>
    <Navigation />
  </SignInContext.Provider>
);
```

In the above snippet, `isLoading` means that we're still checking if we have a token. This can usually be done by checking if we have a token in `SecureStore` and validating the token. After we get the token and if it's valid, we need to set the `userToken`. We also have another state called `isSignout` to have a different animation on sign out.

Next, we're exposing the sign in status via the `SignInContext` so that it's available to the `useIsSignedIn` and `useIsSignedOut` hooks.

In the above example, we're have one screen for each case. But you could also define multiple screens. For example, you probably want to define password reset, signup, etc screens as well when the user isn't signed in. Similarly for the screens accessible after sign in, you probably have more than one screen. We can use [`groups`](static-configuration.md#groups) to define multiple screens:

```js
const RootStack = createNativeStackNavigator({
  screens: {
    // Common screens
  },
  groups: {
    SignedIn: {
      if: useIsSignedIn,
      screens: {
        Home: HomeScreen,
        Profile: ProfileScreen,
      },
    },
    SignedOut: {
      if: useIsSignedOut,
      screens: {
        SignIn: SignInScreen,
        SignUp: SignUpScreen,
        ResetPassword: ResetPasswordScreen,
      },
    },
  },
});
```

:::tip

If you have both your login-related screens and rest of the screens in Stack navigators, we recommend to use a single Stack navigator and place the conditional inside instead of using 2 different navigators. This makes it possible to have a proper transition animation during login/logout.

After we get the token and if it's valid, we need to set the `userToken`. We also have another state called `isSignout` to have a different animation on sign out.

The main thing to notice is that we're conditionally defining screens based on these state variables:

- `SignIn` screen is only defined if `userToken` is `null` (user is not signed in)
- `Home` screen is only defined if `userToken` is non-null (user is signed in)

Here, we're conditionally defining one screen for each case. But you could also define multiple screens. For example, you probably want to define password reset, signup, etc screens as well when the user isn't signed in. Similarly, for the screens accessible after signing in, you probably have more than one screen. We can use `React.Fragment` to define multiple screens:

function useIsSignedIn() {
  const isSignedIn = React.useContext(SignInContext);

  return !isSignedIn;

) : (

## Implement the logic for restoring the token

:::note

The following is just an example of how you might implement the logic for authentication in your app. You don't need to follow it as is.

:::

From the previous snippet, we can see that we need 3 state variables:

- `isLoading` - We set this to `true` when we're trying to check if we already have a token saved in `SecureStore`
- `isSignout` - We set this to `true` when user is signing out, otherwise set it to `false`
- `userToken` - The token for the user. If it's non-null, we assume the user is logged in, otherwise not.

So we need to:

- Add some logic for restoring token, signing in and signing out
- Expose methods for signing in and signing out to other components

We'll use `React.useReducer` and `React.useContext` in this guide. But if you're using a state management library such as Redux or Mobx, you can use them for this functionality instead. In fact, in bigger apps, a global state management library is more suitable for storing authentication tokens. You can adapt the same approach to your state management library.

First we'll need to create a context for auth where we can expose the necessary methods:

```js
import * as React from 'react';

const AuthContext = React.createContext();
```

In our component, we will:

- Store the token and loading state in `useReducer`
- Persist it to `SecureStore` and read it from there on app launch
- Expose the methods for sign in and sign out to child components using `AuthContext`

So our component will look like this:
<Tabs groupId="config" queryString="config">
<TabItem value="static" label="Static" default>

```js name="Signing in and signing out with AuthContext" snack dependencies=expo-secure-store
// codeblock-focus-start

const AuthContext = React.createContext();

const SignInContext = React.createContext();

function useIsSignedIn() {
  const isSignedIn = React.useContext(SignInContext);
  return isSignedIn;
}

function useIsSignedOut() {
  const isSignedIn = React.useContext(SignInContext);
  return !isSignedIn;
}

function SplashScreen() {
  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Loading...</Text>
    </View>
  );
}

function HomeScreen() {
  const { signOut } = React.useContext(AuthContext);

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Signed in!</Text>
      <Button onPress={signOut}>Sign out</Button>
    </View>
  );
}

function SignInScreen() {
  const [username, setUsername] = React.useState('');
  const [password, setPassword] = React.useState('');

  const { signIn } = React.useContext(AuthContext);

                title: 'Sign in',
                // When logging out, a pop animation feels intuitive
                animationTypeForReplace: state.isSignout ? 'pop' : 'push',
              }}
            />
          ) : (
            // User is signed in
            <Stack.Screen name="Home" component={HomeScreen} />
          )}
        </Stack.Navigator>
      </NavigationContainer>
    </AuthContext.Provider>
  );
}
// codeblock-focus-end
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Fill in other components

We won't talk about how to implement the text inputs and buttons for the authentication screen, that is outside of the scope of navigation. We'll just fill in some placeholder content.

```js
function SignInScreen() {
  const [username, setUsername] = React.useState('');
  const [password, setPassword] = React.useState('');

  const { signIn } = React.useContext(AuthContext);

  return (
    <View>
      <TextInput
        placeholder="Username"
        value={username}
        onChangeText={setUsername}
      />
      <TextInput
        placeholder="Password"
        value={password}
        onChangeText={setPassword}
        secureTextEntry
      />
      <Button onPress={() => signIn({ username, password })}>Sign in</Button>
    </View>
  );
}
```

You can similarly fill in the other screens according to your requirements.

## Removing shared screens when auth state changes

Consider the following example:

<Tabs groupId="config" queryString="config">
<TabItem value="static" label="Static" default>

```js
const RootStack = createNativeStackNavigator({
  groups: {
    LoggedIn: {
      if: useIsSignedIn,
      screens: {
        Home: HomeScreen,
        Profile: ProfileScreen,
      },
    },
    LoggedOut: {
      if: useIsSignedOut,
      screens: {
        SignIn: SignInScreen,
        SignUp: SignUpScreen,
      },
    },
  },
  screens: {
    Help: HelpScreen,
  },
});
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="dynamic" label="Dynamic">

```js
isSignedIn ? (
  <>
    <Stack.Screen name="Home" component={HomeScreen} />
    <Stack.Screen name="Profile" component={ProfileScreen} />
    <Stack.Screen name="Help" component={HelpScreen} />
  </>
) : (
  <>
    <Stack.Screen name="SignIn" component={SignInScreen} />
    <Stack.Screen name="SignUp" component={SignUpScreen} />
    <Stack.Screen name="Help" component={HelpScreen} />
  </>
);
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Here we have specific screens such as `SignIn`, `Home` etc. which are only shown depending on the sign in state. But we also have the `Help` screen which can be shown regardless of the login status. This also means that if the sign in state changes when the user is in the `Help` screen, they'll stay on the `Help` screen.

This can be a problem, we probably want the user to be taken to the `SignIn` screen or `Home` screen instead of keeping them on the `Help` screen.

<Tabs groupId="config" queryString="config">
<TabItem value="static" label="Static" default>

To make this work, we can move the `Help` screen to both of the groups instead of keeping it outside. This will ensure that the [`navigationKey`](screen.md#navigation-key) (the name of the group) for the screen changes when the sign in state changes.

So our updated code will look like the following:

```js
const RootStack = createNativeStackNavigator({
  groups: {
    LoggedIn: {
      if: useIsSignedIn,
      screens: {
        Home: HomeScreen,
        Profile: ProfileScreen,
        Help: HelpScreen,
      },
    },
    LoggedOut: {
      if: useIsSignedOut,
      screens: {
        SignIn: SignInScreen,
        SignUp: SignUpScreen,
        Help: HelpScreen,
      },
    },
  },
});
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="dynamic" label="Dynamic">

To make this work, we can use [`navigationKey`](screen.md#navigation-key). When the `navigationKey` changes, React Navigation will remove all the screen.

So our updated code will look like the following:

```js
<>
  {isSignedIn ? (
    <>
      <Stack.Screen name="Home" component={HomeScreen} />
      <Stack.Screen name="Profile" component={ProfileScreen} />
    </>
  ) : (
    <>
      <Stack.Screen name="SignIn" component={SignInScreen} />
      <Stack.Screen name="SignUp" component={SignUpScreen} />
    </>
  )}
  <Stack.Screen
    navigationKey={isSignedIn ? 'user' : 'guest'}
    name="Help"
    component={HelpScreen}
  />
</>
```

If you have a bunch of shared screens, you can also use [`navigationKey` with a `Group`](group.md#navigation-key) to remove all of the screens in the group. For example:

```js
<>
  {isSignedIn ? (
    <>
      <Stack.Screen name="Home" component={HomeScreen} />
      <Stack.Screen name="Profile" component={ProfileScreen} />
    </>
  ) : (
    <>
      <Stack.Screen name="SignIn" component={SignInScreen} />
      <Stack.Screen name="SignUp" component={SignUpScreen} />
    </>
  )}
  <Stack.Group navigationKey={isSignedIn ? 'user' : 'guest'}>
    <Stack.Screen name="Help" component={HelpScreen} />
    <Stack.Screen name="About" component={AboutScreen} />
  </Stack.Group>
</>
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Don't manually navigate when conditionally rendering screens

It's important to note that when using such a setup, you **don't manually navigate** to the `Home` screen by calling `navigation.navigate('Home')` or any other method. **React Navigation will automatically navigate to the correct screen** when `isSignedIn` changes - `Home` screen when `isSignedIn` becomes `true`, and to `SignIn` screen when `isSignedIn` becomes `false`. You'll get an error if you attempt to navigate manually.
