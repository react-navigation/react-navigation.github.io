The bulk of the static configuration is done using the `createXNavigator` functions, e.g. [`createNativeStackNavigator`](native-stack-navigator.md), [`createBottomTabNavigator`](bottom-tab-navigator.md), [`createDrawerNavigator`](drawer-navigator.md) etc. We'll refer to these functions as `createXNavigator` in the rest of this guide.

## `createXNavigator`

The `createXNavigator` functions take one argument, which is an object with the following properties:

- Same props as the navigator component, e.g. `id`, `initialRouteName`, `screenOptions` etc. See [Navigator](navigator.md) as well as the docs for each navigator for more details on the props they accept.
- `screens` - an object containing configuration for each screen in the navigator.
- `groups` - an optional object containing groups of screens (equivalent to [`Group`](group.md) in the dynamic API).

For example:

```js
const RootStack = createNativeStackNavigator({
  initialRouteName: 'Home',
  screenOptions: {
    headerTintColor: 'white',
    headerStyle: {
      backgroundColor: 'tomato',
    },
  },
  screens: {
    Home: HomeScreen,
    Profile: ProfileScreen,
  },
});
```

### `screens`

The `screens` object can contain key value pairs where the key is the name of the screen and the value can be several things:

- A component to render:

  ```js
  const RootStack = createNativeStackNavigator({
    screens: {
      Home: HomeScreen,
    },
  });
  ```

- A navigator configured using `createXNavigator` for nested navigators:

  ```js
  const HomeTabs = createBottomTabNavigator({
    screens: {
      Groups: GroupsScreen,
      Chats: ChatsScreen,
    },
  });

  const RootStack = createNativeStackNavigator({
    screens: {
      Home: HomeTabs,
    },
  });
  ```

- An object containing configuration for the screen. This configuration contains the various properties:

  ```js
  const RootStack = createNativeStackNavigator({
    screens: {
      Home: {
        screen: HomeScreen,
        linking: {
          path: 'home',
        },
      },
    },
  });
  ```

  See [Screen configuration](#screen-configuration) for more details.

### `groups`

The `groups` object can contain key-value pairs where the key is the name of the group and the value is the group configuration.

The configuration object for a screen accepts the [properties described in the Group page](group.md). In addition, the following properties are available when using static configuration:

- `if` - this can be used to conditionally render the group and works the same as the [`if` property in the screen configuration](#if).
- `screens` - an object containing configuration for each screen in the group. The configuration is the same as the [`screens` object in the navigator configuration](#screens).

Example:

```js
const RootStack = createNativeStackNavigator({
  screens: {
    Home: HomeScreen,
    Profile: ProfileScreen,
  },
  groups: {
    Guest: {
      if: useIsGuest,
      screenOptions: {
        headerShown: false,
      },
      screens: {
        // ...
      },
    },
    User: {
      if: useIsUser,
      screens: {
        // ...
      },
    },
  },
});
```

### Screen configuration

The configuration object for a screen accepts the [properties described in the Screen page](screen.md). In addition, the following properties are available when using static configuration:

#### `linking`

[Linking configuration](configuring-links.md) for the screen. It can be either a string for a path or an object with the linking configuration:

```js
const RootStack = createNativeStackNavigator({
  screens: {
    Profile: {
      screen: ProfileScreen,
      linking: {
        path: 'u/:userId',
        parse: {
          userId: (id) => id.replace(/^@/, ''),
        },
        stringify: {
          userId: (id) => `@${id}`,
        },
      },
    },
    Chat: {
      screen: ChatScreen,
      linking: 'chat/:chatId',
    },
  },
});
```

The `linking` object supports the same configuration options described in [Configuring links](configuring-links.md) such as `parse`, `stringify` and `exact`.

To make deep links work on native apps, you also need to [configure your app](deep-linking.md) and pass `prefixes` to the navigation component returned by [`createStaticNavigation`](static-configuration.md#createstaticnavigation):

```js
const Navigation = createStaticNavigation(RootStack);

const linking = {
  prefixes: ['https://example.com', 'example://'],
};

function App() {
  return <Navigation linking={linking} />;
}
```

#### `if`

Callback to determine whether the screen should be rendered or not. It doesn't receive any arguments. This can be useful for conditional rendering of screens, e.g. - if you want to render a different screen for logged in users.

You can use a custom hook to use custom logic to determine the return value:

```js
const useIsLoggedIn = () => {
  const { isLoggedIn } = React.useContext(AuthContext);

  return isLoggedIn;
};

const RootStack = createNativeStackNavigator({
  screens: {
    Home: {
      screen: HomeScreen,
      if: useIsLoggedIn,
    },
  },
});
```

The above example will only render the `HomeScreen` if the user is logged in.

For more details, see [Authentication flow](auth-flow.md?config=static).

## `createStaticNavigation`

The `createStaticNavigation` function takes the static config returned by `createXNavigator` functions and returns a React component to render:

```js
const Navigation = createStaticNavigation(RootStack);

function App() {
  return <Navigation />;
}
```

This component is a wrapper around the `NavigationContainer` component and accepts the [same props and ref as the `NavigationContainer`](navigation-container.md) component. It is intended to be rendered once at the root of your app similar to how you'd use `NavigationContainer` component.

### Differences in the `linking` prop

Similar to `NavigationContainer`, the component returned by `createStaticNavigation` also accepts a [`linking`](navigation-container.md#linking) prop. However, there are some key differences:

1. It's not possible to pass a full `config` object to the `linking` prop. It can only accept [`path`](configuring-links.md#apps-under-subpaths) and an [`initialRouteName` for the root navigator](configuring-links.md#rendering-an-initial-route).
2. The linking config is collected from the [`linking`](#linking) properties specified in the screen configuration.
3. It's possible to pass `enabled: 'auto'` to automatically generate paths for all leaf screens:

   ```js
   const Navigation = createStaticNavigation(RootStack);

   const linking = {
     enabled: 'auto',
     prefixes: ['https://example.com', 'example://'],
   };

   function App() {
     return <Navigation linking={linking} />;
   }
   ```

   See [How does automatic path generation work](configuring-links.md#how-does-automatic-path-generation-work) for more details.

## `createComponentForStaticNavigation`

The `createComponentForStaticNavigation` function takes the static config returned by `createXNavigator` functions and returns a React component to render. The second argument is a name for the component that'd be used in React DevTools:

```js
const RootStackNavigator = createComponentForStaticNavigation(
  RootStack,
  'RootNavigator'
);
```

The returned component doesn't take any props. All of the configuration is inferred from the static config. It's essentially the same as defining a component using the dynamic API.

This looks similar to `createStaticNavigation` however they are very different. When using static configuration, you'd never use this function directly. The only time you'd use this is if you're migrating away from static configuration and want to reuse existing code you wrote instead of rewriting it to the dynamic API. See [Combining static and dynamic APIs](combine-static-with-dynamic.md) for more details.

## `createPathConfigForStaticNavigation`

The `createPathConfigForStaticNavigation` function takes the static config returned by `createXNavigator` functions and returns a path config object that can be used within the linking config.

```js
const config = {
  screens: {
    Home: {
      screens: createPathConfigForStaticNavigation(HomeTabs),
    },
  },
};
```

Similar to `createComponentForStaticNavigation`, this is intended to be used when migrating away from static configuration. See [Combining static and dynamic APIs](combine-static-with-dynamic.md) for more details.
