This page contains links to pages that will guide you through the process of upgrading React Navigation:

- [Upgrading from 6.x to 7.x](../version-7.x/upgrading-from-6.x.md)
- [Upgrading from 5.x to 6.x](../version-6.x/upgrading-from-5.x.md)
- [Upgrading from 4.x to 5.x](../version-5.x/upgrading-from-4.x.md)
- [Upgrading from 3.x to 4.x](../version-4.x/upgrading-from-3.x.md)

If you're upgrading from a version older by multiple major releases, please refer to the migration guides of all the versions in between when upgrading. We recommend configuring TypeScript for your React Navigation setup to make it easier to upgrade as you'll get type errors.
