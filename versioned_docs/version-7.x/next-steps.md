You're now familiar with stack navigators, navigation between routes, and displaying [modals](modal.md). For tab-based navigation, check out the [Bottom Tabs Navigator](bottom-tab-navigator.md).

See the **"Navigators"** section in the sidebar to learn more about the different navigators.

The rest of the documentation is organized around specific use cases under **"Guides"**. Some guides you may want to check out:

- [Authentication flows](auth-flow.md)
- [Supporting safe areas](handling-safe-area.md)
- [Deep linking](deep-linking.md)
- [Themes](themes.md)
- [Testing with Jest](testing.md)
- [Configuring TypeScript](typescript.md)

To learn more about how React Navigation works internally, see the [Navigation State reference](navigation-state.md) and [Build your own Navigator](custom-navigators.md) sections.

Good luck!
