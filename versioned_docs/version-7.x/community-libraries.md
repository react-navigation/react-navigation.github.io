This guide lists various community libraries that can be used alongside React Navigation to enhance its functionality.

:::note

Please refer to the library's documentation to see which version of React Navigation it supports.

## react-native-screen-transitions

A library that provides customizable screen transition animations for React Navigation's [Native Stack Navigator](native-stack-navigator.md).

[Repository](https://github.com/eds2002/react-native-screen-transitions)

## react-navigation-header-buttons

Helps you to render buttons in the navigation bar and handle the styling so you don't have to. It tries to mimic the appearance of native navbar buttons and attempts to offer a simple interface for you to interact with.

[Repository](https://github.com/vonovak/react-navigation-header-buttons)

## react-navigation-props-mapper

Provides simple HOCs that map react-navigation props to your screen components directly - ie. instead of `const user = this.props.route.params.activeUser`, you'd write `const user = this.props.activeUser`.
