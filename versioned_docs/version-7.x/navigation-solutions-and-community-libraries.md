# Solutions built on top of React Navigation

# Community libraries

## react-native-screens

This project aims to expose native navigation container components to React Native and React Navigation can integrate with it since version 2.14.0. Using `react-native-screens` brings several benefits, such as support for the ["reachability feature"](https://www.cnet.com/how-to/how-to-use-reachability-on-iphone-6-6-plus/) on iOS, and improved memory consumption on both platforms.

## react-navigation-header-buttons

Helps you to render buttons in the navigation bar and handle the styling so you don't have to. It tries to mimic the appearance of native navbar buttons and attempts to offer a simple interface for you to interact with.

## react-navigation-props-mapper

Provides simple HOCs that map react-navigation props to your screen components directly - ie. instead of `const user = this.props.route.params.activeUser`, you'd write `const user = this.props.activeUser`.
