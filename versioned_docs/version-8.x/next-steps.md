You now know how to create a stack navigator, configure screens, navigate between routes, and display [modals](modal.md).

Stack navigators and their related APIs will be the most frequently used tools in your React Navigation toolbelt, but there are problems that they don't solve. For example, you can't build tab-based navigation using a stack navigator &mdash; for that, you need to use a [Bottom Tabs Navigator](bottom-tab-navigator.md).

You can check out the **"Navigators"** section in the sidebar to learn more about the different navigators available in React Navigation.

The **"Guides"** section covers common topics that you'll encounter when building navigation in your app. Some of the guides you may want to check out are:

- [Authentication flows](auth-flow.md)
- [Supporting safe areas](handling-safe-area.md)
- [Deep linking](deep-linking.md)
- [Themes](themes.md)
- [Testing with Jest](testing.md)
- [Configuring TypeScript](typescript.md)

While most users won't need to do this, if you are curious and want to learn more about how React Navigation works, it's recommended to work through the [Navigation State reference](navigation-state.md) and [Build your own Navigator](custom-navigators.md) sections.

Good luck!
