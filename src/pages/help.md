If you believe there is a feature missing, please [create a feature request on Canny](https://react-navigation.canny.io/feature-requests), or if you're feeling up for the task of proposing an API for the feature, [create a discussion](https://github.com/react-navigation/react-navigation/discussions).

If you just need some help, try joining the `#help-react-native` channel on [Reactiflux Discord](https://www.reactiflux.com) or [post a question to StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/react-navigation).
